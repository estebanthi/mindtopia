# Convolution
---
Convolution is a mathematical operation that involves combining two functions to produce a third function that expresses how the shape of one function is modified by the other. In signal processing and image processing, convolution is used to analyze and manipulate signals and images.

The basic idea of convolution is to slide one function (called the kernel or filter) over the other function (called the input signal) and multiply the values at each point, and then sum the results. This process is repeated for every point in the input signal, resulting in a new signal that represents the modified input signal.

Convolution is used in a variety of signal processing applications, including audio and speech processing, image and video processing, and digital signal processing. It is also used in machine learning and deep learning, where it is used to perform feature extraction on input data, such as images or audio signals.
