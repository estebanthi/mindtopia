# Condensation
---
Condensation is a process of phase change where a substance changes from a gas or vapor to a liquid state. This can occur when the temperature of the gas or vapor decreases, or when the pressure on the gas or vapor increases. When the gas or vapor loses energy, its molecules slow down and come closer together, leading to the formation of liquid droplets.

The opposite process of condensation is called [[Vaporizatopn\|Vaporizatopn]] or [[Evaporation\|Evaporation]], where a liquid turns into a gas or vapor state. Condensation plays an important role in the water cycle, where water vapor in the atmosphere condenses to form clouds, and then precipitation such as rain, snow, or hail. It also occurs in many other natural and industrial processes, such as the formation of dew on grass, the distillation of alcohol, and the production of steam in power plants.
