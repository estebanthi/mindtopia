# Principle of Conversation of Flow
---
The principle of conservation of flow is a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics, which states that the total mass flow rate into and out of a control volume must be equal to the rate of change of mass within that control volume. In other words, the principle of conservation of flow is based on the idea that mass cannot be created or destroyed within a closed system, and any change in mass within that system must be accounted for by the flow of mass across its boundaries.

Mathematically, the principle of conservation of flow can be expressed as:
d/dt (integral of rhodV) + integral of (rhov . n) * dA = 0
where rho is the density of the fluid, v is the velocity vector, n is the outward normal vector to the control surface, dV is the differential volume element, and dA is the differential area element.

This equation is also known as the continuity equation, and it is a statement of the conservation of mass. It is widely used in fluid dynamics to analyze the behavior of fluids and their interactions with solid structures.
