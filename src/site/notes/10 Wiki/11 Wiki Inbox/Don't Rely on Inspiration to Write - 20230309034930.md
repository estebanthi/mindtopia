# Don't Rely on Inspiration to Write
---
While inspiration can be a great starting point for writing, relying solely on it can lead to several problems. Here are some reasons why we shouldn't rely on inspiration to write:
- **Inconsistency**: If we wait for inspiration to strike before we start writing, we may find ourselves writing only sporadically. This can result in a lack of consistency in our writing habits, making it difficult to make progress on our work.
- **Procrastination**: Waiting for inspiration can lead to procrastination. It's easy to put off writing until we feel inspired, but this can result in missed deadlines and a lack of productivity.
- **Unfinished work**: Relying on inspiration can also lead to unfinished work. If we start writing one book and then switch to another as soon as we have a new idea, we may never finish any of our projects.
- **Dependence**: Finally, relying too much on inspiration can create a sense of dependence on it. This can make it difficult to write when we're not feeling inspired, leading to a lack of progress on our work.
