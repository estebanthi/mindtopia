# Chemical Bond
---
A chemical bond is a force of attraction that holds two or more atoms together in a molecule or compound. Atoms form chemical bonds by sharing or exchanging electrons in their outermost energy levels (valence electrons). The type of bond that forms between atoms depends on the electronegativity difference between them.

## Several types of bonds

**Weak** (Van der Waals) bonds:
