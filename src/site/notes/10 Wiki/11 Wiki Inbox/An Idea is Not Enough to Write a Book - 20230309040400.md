# An Idea is Not Enough to Write a Book
---
Having an idea is good. But a book is the accumulation of a huge amount of ideas. You'll have to think and make decisions at every turn.

You need a basic premise, and then: one or more protagonists, companions, one or more antagonists, story arcs, goals that the characters have to reach, different conflicts, worldbuilding, deciding on the point of view...

A story is mostly about characters, plots, a universe, all of which are linked by conflicts. The main character is the one through whose eyes the reader will discover a universe. If he is neglected, the reader will throw the book in a corner.
