# Approval for Return to Service
---
An approval for return to service (RTS) is a document issued by an authorized organization, such as an aviation authority or a maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facility, that certifies that a particular aircraft, engine, or component has been inspected, repaired, or overhauled and is now safe to return to service.

The approval for RTS is usually required before an aircraft or component can be operated again. It is issued after maintenance has been done on the aircraft and the aircraft has been found airworthy by the authorized organization.
