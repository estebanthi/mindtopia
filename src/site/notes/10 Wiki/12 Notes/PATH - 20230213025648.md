# PATH
---
The PATH is an environment variable on a computer that stores a list of directories. The purpose of the PATH variable is to specify a set of directories that the operating system should search for executables (e.g., .exe files on Windows, or shell scripts on Linux/macOS) when a user types a command in the terminal.

When you type a command in the terminal, the operating system will search through each directory in the PATH in order, and run the first executable it finds with a matching name. If the executable is not found in any of the directories specified in the PATH, you'll get an error message indicating that the command could not be found.

In most cases, you can add new directories to the PATH or modify the existing directories to change the way the operating system searches for executables. This can be useful, for example, if you want to run executables from your own custom scripts directory, or if you want to run a specific version of a command that's different from the one that would otherwise be executed.
