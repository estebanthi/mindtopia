# Aeronautical Cooling
---
Aircraft are cooled by **air**. Cylinders are fitted with [[Fin\|Fins]] to increase the air/metal surface area.

Sometimes [[Hood Flaps\|Hood Flaps]] are present, which must be opened in overheated conditions (high power and low speed), and closed when the temperature drops (descent).

The optimum operating temperature is **80Â°C** for aircraft engines.

## Control instruments
- **Oil temperature**: engine temperature
- **Cylinder temperature** : metal temperature => instantaneous temperature

## Overheating
- Check oil pressure
- Open bonnet flaps
- Stop the rise
- Reduce power
- Check mixture richness (too lean?)

## Thermal shock
Avoid too sudden variations in engine temperature (e.g. going from a big climb to a big descent).
