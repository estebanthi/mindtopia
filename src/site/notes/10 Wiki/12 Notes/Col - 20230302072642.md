# Col
---
In [[10 Wiki/13 Plantations/Meteorology - 20230221103137\|Meteorology]], a col (short for "col de sac") is a low point or saddle between two adjacent peaks or ridges of high pressure. A col can also refer to a region of relatively low pressure surrounded by higher pressure areas.

A col is often associated with calm or variable [[100 Zettelkasten/Wind\|Wind]] conditions, as air flows from the high pressure areas on either side of the col toward the lower pressure area. This can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation in the vicinity of the col.

The behavior of a col can have significant impacts on weather patterns and the movement of air masses. For example, a col can act as a barrier that prevents the movement of air masses from one side to the other, leading to stagnation and the formation of persistent weather patterns. Alternatively, a col can act as a channel that funnels air masses through a particular region, leading to increased wind speeds and turbulence.
