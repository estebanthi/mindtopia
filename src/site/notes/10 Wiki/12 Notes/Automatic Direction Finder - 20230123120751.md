# Automatic Direction Finder
---
The automatic direction finder, also called **radio compass**, refers to the on-board receiver. It consists of ground and aircraft equipment.

## Ground Equipment
There are two types of equipment depending on where this equipment is installed.

If it's near an [[Aerodrome\|Aerodrome]], we talk about a **locator**. The **locator** is intended for [[100 Zettelkasten/IFR\|IFR]] approach. It is usually identified by two letters.

If it's in the field, we talk about the **NDB**. The NDB (Non Directional Beacon) is identified by three letters.

## Aircraft Equipment
Consists of an antenna placed under the aircraft, a receiver to select the frequency and operating mode, and an indicator to read the bearing.

## How does it Work?
The ground beacon emits an omni-directional signal which is received by the antenna. The display then shows a bearing, which is the angle between the [[100 Zettelkasten/Heading\|Heading]] and the direction of the beacon.

## Errors
The radio compass is sensitive to atmospheric disturbances. In stormy weather, the needle will tend to indicate thunderstorms.
In addition, during twilight, the information is unreliable as the wave reflects off the upper layers of the Earth's atmosphere.
