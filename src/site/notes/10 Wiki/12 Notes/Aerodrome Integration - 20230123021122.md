# Aerodrome Integration
---
The [[Aerodrome\|Aerodrome]] integration consists of entering an aerodrome and [[Landing\|Landing]].

## On Controlled [[Aerodrome\|Aerodrome]]
You must comply with control clearances before performing your [[Aerodrome Circuit\|Aerodrome Circuit]].


## On Uncontrolled [[Aerodrome\|Aerodrome]]
The integration is done at the beginning of the [[Downwind Leg\|Downwind Leg]] after a vertical pass to check the information on the [[Aerodrome\|Aerodrome]] and the state of the ground.

The vertical is done above the highest of the runway turns. 500ft is a good margin.
