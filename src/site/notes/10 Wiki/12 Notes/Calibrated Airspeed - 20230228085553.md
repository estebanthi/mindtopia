# Calibrated Airspeed
---
Calibrated airspeed is the airspeed measured by an aircraft's airspeed indicator, which has been adjusted to account for instrument and position errors. It is the most accurate representation of the aircraft's actual speed through the air.

As an aircraft moves through the air, the airspeed indicator measures the dynamic pressure of the air flowing over the aircraft's pitot tube. This measurement is then adjusted by the aircraft's air data computer to account for errors caused by factors such as instrument and position errors, static pressure errors, and compressibility effects.

The result is the calibrated airspeed, which is the airspeed indicated by the airspeed indicator corrected for these errors. This airspeed is used by pilots to determine the aircraft's performance and to maintain safe flight operations.
