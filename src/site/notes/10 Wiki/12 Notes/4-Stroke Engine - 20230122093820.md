# 4-Stroke Engine
---
1. **Intake**: Piston descends into the cylinder and sucks in the gases which pass through the intake valve. The exhaust valve is closed.
2. **Compression**: Two valves are closed. Piston rises and compresses the mixture ignited by the spark plugs.
3. **Explosion/Expansion**: Piston propelled downwards, movement transmitted to the propeller by the crankshaft.
4. **Exhaust**: Intake closed, exhaust open. Piston rises and ejects burnt gases. Then back to the beginning of the cycle.
