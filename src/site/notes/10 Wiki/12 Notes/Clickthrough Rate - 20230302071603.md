# Clickthrough Rate
---
Clickthrough rate (CTR) is a metric used in [[10 Wiki/13 Plantations/Digital Marketing - 20230302071640\|Digital Marketing]] that measures the percentage of people who click on a link or advertisement after viewing it. CTR is calculated by dividing the number of clicks on an ad by the number of times the ad was shown (impressions), and then multiplying the result by 100.

CTR is an important metric for advertisers because it indicates how effective their ads are at generating interest and engagement from potential customers. Higher CTRs generally indicate that an ad is more relevant, engaging, or attractive to its target audience, while lower CTRs may suggest that the ad needs to be improved or that the audience is not the right fit for the ad.

Factors that can affect CTR include the ad's placement, format, design, messaging, targeting, and competition from other ads. CTR is commonly used in search engine advertising, social media advertising, and email marketing, among other channels. However, it is important to note that CTR alone may not provide a complete picture of the success or effectiveness of an ad campaign, and other metrics such as conversion rate, cost per click (CPC), and return on investment (ROI) should also be considered.
