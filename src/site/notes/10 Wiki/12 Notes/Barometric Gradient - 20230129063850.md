# Barometric Gradient
---
The barometric gradient refers to the difference in air pressure between two points. It is calculated as the difference in atmospheric pressure between two points divided by the distance between them.

The barometric gradient is a fundamental concept in meteorology and atmospheric science, as it affects the movement of air and the formation of weather patterns. For example, a steep barometric gradient can lead to the formation of strong winds, while a shallow gradient can lead to calm conditions.

The barometric gradient also plays an important role in aviation, as it can affect the performance of an [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aircraft - 20230125033243\|Aircraft]]. For example, a steep barometric gradient can lead to turbulence, while a shallow gradient can lead to calm air. Pilots must be aware of the barometric gradient in their flight path and take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of their flight.

The barometric gradient can also be used in various scientific and engineering applications, such as the measurement of air pressure in a given area, or the calculation of air flow patterns in a wind tunnel.
