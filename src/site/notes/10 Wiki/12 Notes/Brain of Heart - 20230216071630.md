# Brain of Heart
---
The belief is that the [[100 Zettelkasten/120 MOC/Brain\|Brain]] is the control centre of the human body. We have never questioned this. However, the heart can also be seen as a "small" brain.

Indeed, in ancient traditions, the heart has always been thought to be the centre of wisdom, emotions and memory.


## The Powers of the Heart
- 40,000 specialised neurons form a network in our heart, allowing it to communicate with our body, detect hormonal needs, etc.
- Memory transfer during a heart transplant (note that this is controversial).
- The heart allows us to make instant decisions: it is the key to awakening deep intuition.
