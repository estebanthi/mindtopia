# Battery
---
A battery is an electrical device that stores and converts chemical energy into electrical energy. It consists of one or more cells, each of which is made up of two [[Electrode\|Electrodes]] (anode and cathode) separated by an [[Electrolyte\|Electrolyte]].

When a battery is connected to a circuit, the [[100 Zettelkasten/Electron\|Electrons]] flow from the anode to the cathode, creating a current. The chemical reaction between the electrodes and the electrolyte releases energy, which is converted into electrical energy and can be used to power electrical devices.

There are several different types of batteries, including primary batteries (also known as disposable batteries), which are designed to be used once and discarded, and secondary batteries (also known as rechargeable batteries), which can be recharged and used multiple times.

Primary batteries are typically used in low-power applications, such as flashlights, remote controls, and toys, while secondary batteries are used in higher-power applications, such as laptops, cell phones, and electric vehicles.
