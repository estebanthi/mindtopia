# Airspace
---
Airspace refers to the three-dimensional region above the surface of the Earth that is regulated by a country's aviation authorities for the purposes of air traffic control and safety.

It is divided into different classes based on the level of air traffic control and regulations that apply, as well as the type of aircraft that are allowed to fly in that airspace.

Airspace can be categorized this way:
- [[Controlled Airspace\|Controlled Airspace]]
- [[100 Zettelkasten/Uncontrolled Airspace\|Uncontrolled Airspace]]
- [[100 Zettelkasten/Upper Airspace\|Upper Airspace]]
- [[100 Zettelkasten/Lower Airspace\|Lower Airspace]]

Or this way:
- [[Class A Airspace\|Class A Airspace]]
- [[Class B Airspace\|Class B Airspace]]
- [[Class C Airspace\|Class C Airspace]]
- [[Class D Airspace\|Class D Airspace]]
- [[Class E Airspace\|Class E Airspace]]
- [[Class G Airspace\|Class G Airspace]]
