# Piercing Line
---
In [[10 Wiki/13 Plantations/Technical Analysis - 20230221094216\|Technical Analysis - 20230221094216]], a piercing line is a bullish [[10 Wiki/13 Plantations/Candlestick Pattern - 20230221094146\|Candlestick Pattern - 20230221094146]] that can indicate a potential reversal in price trend. The pattern occurs when a long black or red candle is followed by a long white or green candle that opens below the previous day's low and closes above the midpoint of the first candle's real body.

The pattern is called a piercing line because the white or green candle "pierces" or penetrates the previous day's black or red candle, suggesting a shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish. The pattern is often seen as a signal that the selling pressure is losing momentum and that the bulls may be taking control.
