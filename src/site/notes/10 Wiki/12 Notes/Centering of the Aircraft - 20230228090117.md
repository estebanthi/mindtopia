# Centering of the Aircraft
---
This is an essential factor in the [[Longitudinal Stability\|Longitudinal Stability]] of the [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aircraft - 20230125033243\|Aircraft - 20230125033243]]. It corresponds to the position of the [[Center of Gravity\|Center of Gravity]].

For the aircraft to be stable, the center of gravity must be forward of the [[100 Zettelkasten/Focus\|Focus]] and within the Center of Gravity range.

If the aircraft is rear centred, it will be more manoeuvrable and care must be taken with the sensitivity of the controls.
If it is front centred, it will be stable and not very manoeuvrable.

An out-of-centre aircraft is no longer flyable.


## Calculation
The calculations are performed using the [[100 Zettelkasten/Flight Manual\|Flight Manual]] and the [[Weight Sheet\|Weight Sheet]].

The total weight of the aircraft is measured. Then, the lever arms applied to determine the [[Moment\|Moment]]s of the forces are determined.

The sum of the moments is then calculated and divided by the total mass to obtain the position of the [[Center of Gravity\|Center of Gravity]] of the [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aircraft - 20230125033243\|Aircraft - 20230125033243]].
