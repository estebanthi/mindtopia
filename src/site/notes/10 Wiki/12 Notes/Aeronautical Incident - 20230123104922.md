# Aeronautical Incident
---
An incident occurs whenever the safety of an [[100 Zettelkasten/Aircraft\|Aircraft]] is challenged by another [[100 Zettelkasten/Aircraft\|Aircraft]]. In this case, a radio message is initiated: "Initial AIRPROX message" followed by the circumstances of the incident, which is confirmed by a written report on landing.

If it is a control body that questions safety, a complaint is filed with the runway office.
