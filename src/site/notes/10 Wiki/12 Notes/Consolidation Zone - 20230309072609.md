# Consolidation Zone
---
In trading, a consolidation zone is a period of time during which the price of an asset is range-bound and does not show a clear trend in either direction. During this time, the price of the asset tends to oscillate between a specific upper and lower level, often forming a pattern such as a rectangle or a triangle on a price chart.

A consolidation zone typically occurs after a significant price movement, either upward or downward, and indicates that the market is taking a break before deciding on the next direction. Traders often use consolidation zones to identify potential areas of [[Support\|Support]] and [[Resistance\|Resistance]], as well as to look for breakout opportunities once the price eventually moves out of the range-bound zone.
