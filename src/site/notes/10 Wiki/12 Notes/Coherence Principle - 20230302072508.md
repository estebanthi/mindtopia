# Coherence Principle
---
The coherence principle in psychology is a cognitive principle that suggests that people have a natural tendency to seek consistency and coherence in their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. According to this principle, people are motivated to reduce cognitive dissonance, which is the discomfort or mental stress that arises from holding conflicting beliefs or ideas.

The coherence principle is based on the assumption that people prefer to have a clear and organized mental representation of the world around them. When people encounter new information or experiences, they tend to interpret them in a way that fits with their existing beliefs and knowledge. This process is known as assimilation.

The coherence principle can lead to biases in thinking and decision-making. For example, people may ignore or distort information that contradicts their beliefs, or they may seek out information that confirms their preexisting beliefs. This can result in a confirmation bias, which is the tendency to favor information that confirms one's preexisting beliefs.
