# Conversions Tracking
---
Conversion tracking is a technique used in online advertising to track the actions taken by users after they interact with an advertisement or website. It involves measuring and analyzing the actions that users take on a website, such as completing a purchase, filling out a form, or subscribing to a newsletter, and attributing those actions to specific advertising campaigns or channels.

Conversion tracking is useful for several reasons:
- **Measuring ROI**: By tracking conversions, advertisers can determine which advertising campaigns are generating the most revenue and return on investment (ROI). This information can be used to optimize campaigns and allocate budgets more effectively.
- **Identifying top-performing channels**: Conversion tracking allows advertisers to identify which channels are driving the most conversions, such as search engines, social media, or display advertising. This information can be used to focus on the most effective channels and adjust strategies for underperforming channels.
- **Improving website performance**: Conversion tracking can also help identify areas of a website that may need improvement, such as checkout pages or lead generation forms. By analyzing conversion data, advertisers can identify potential obstacles or areas of confusion for users and make changes to improve the user experience and increase conversions.
- **Testing and optimizing**: Conversion tracking allows advertisers to test different advertising messages, landing pages, and calls to action to identify the most effective combinations for driving conversions.
