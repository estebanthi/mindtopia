# Aircraft
---
An aircraft is a vehicle designed for air travel. There are several types of aircraft, including [[Airplane\|Airplanes]], [[Helicopter\|Helicopters]], [[Glider\|Gliders]], and [[Air Balloon\|Air Balloons]].

They can vary in size from small single-seat ultralights to large commercial jets. Aircrafts are powered by one or more engines and are able to fly by generating lift through the movement of air over their wings. They are used for transportation of people and goods, military operations, reconnaissance, research, and other purposes.
