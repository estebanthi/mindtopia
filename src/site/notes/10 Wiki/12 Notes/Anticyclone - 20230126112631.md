# Anticyclone
---
An anticyclone is a type of weather system characterized by high pressure at its center and clockwise rotation in the Northern Hemisphere (and counterclockwise rotation in the Southern Hemisphere) around that center. It is the opposite of a low pressure system, which is called a [[Cyclone\|Cyclone]]. In an anticyclone, the winds circulate around the center in a clockwise direction, blowing from the high-pressure center outwards.

Anticyclones are associated with fair weather and light winds, as the winds blowing outwards from the high-pressure center tend to push away clouds and precipitation. They are often associated with clear, sunny weather, and are sometimes referred to as "high-pressure systems." The air in the center of the anticyclone sinks and warms as it is compressed, which can cause the weather to be hot and dry.

Anticyclones can be relatively small and short-lived, or they can be large and persist for several days or even weeks. They can move with the general airflow and can be observed on weather maps. Their movement can affect the weather in the surrounding areas, they can cause a drought, if they are present for a long time in a certain location.
