# Carburettor Heat
---
Carburetor heat is a mechanism used in some [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aircraft - 20230125033243\|Aircraft]] to prevent or remove the buildup of ice within the carburetor. In aircraft with a piston engine, the carburetor is responsible for mixing air and fuel to create the combustible mixture that is then fed into the engine cylinders. As air is drawn into the carburetor, it can cause the temperature inside to drop, which can lead to the formation of ice on the surfaces of the carburetor and other components.

To prevent this ice buildup, carburetor heat is used. The mechanism usually involves diverting hot air from the engine's exhaust system into the carburetor, which raises the temperature inside and melts any ice that has formed. This hot air is controlled by a valve, which can be adjusted by the pilot as needed to maintain the desired temperature inside the carburetor.

While carburetor heat can be effective at preventing ice buildup, it can also cause a decrease in engine performance, since the hot air reduces the density of the air entering the engine. For this reason, pilots are often taught to use carburetor heat sparingly, and only when needed to prevent ice buildup. Additionally, carburetor heat systems can fail or malfunction, so pilots must be prepared to deal with ice buildup in other ways, such as by using alternate air sources or descending to lower altitudes.
