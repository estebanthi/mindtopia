# Aeronautical Oil
---
Oil used in [[10 Wiki/13 Plantations/Aeronautics - 20230221093758\|Aeronautics - 20230221093758]] is a bit specific. It is classified in two types:
- **Mineral**: used for running-in or when changing cylinders
- **Dispersant**: used for high temperature variations

## Grade
The grade of an oil represents its viscosity. As a rule of thumb, one should use oil with a high grade in summer when the temperature is high.
