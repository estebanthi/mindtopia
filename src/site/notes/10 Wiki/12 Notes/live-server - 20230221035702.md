# live-server
---
`live-server` is a simple, live-reloading HTTP server for web development. It is a Node.js package that can be installed globally using npm. Once installed, you can run it from the command line in the root directory of your web project, and it will automatically serve your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and reload the page in the browser whenever changes are made.

Here are some of the most common arguments that can be used with the `live-server` command:

-   `--port=NUMBER`: Specifies the port number for the server to use. By default, it uses port 8080.
-   `--host=ADDRESS`: Specifies the host address for the server to use. By default, it uses `0.0.0.0`.
-   `--open=PATH`: Specifies the path to open in the browser when the server starts up.
-   `--ignore=REGEX`: Specifies a regular expression for files to ignore when watching for changes.
-   `--no-browser`: Prevents the server from automatically opening the browser when it starts up.
-   `--entry-file=FILE`: Specifies the file to use as the default entry point. By default, it looks for `index.html`.
