# Atavism
---
An atavism is a reversion to an earlier type or an ancestral characteristic that has been absent in recent generations of a species. In other words, an atavism is a genetic throwback to an earlier stage of evolution.

This can occur when a gene that has been dormant or suppressed for many generations becomes active again. 

Atavisms can occur in both plants and animals, and can manifest in various ways such as the re-emergence of physical features, behaviors, or diseases that were present in earlier ancestors. Atavisms can also be observed in the [[100 Zettelkasten/Fossil Record\|Fossil Record]], where features that have been lost in a particular lineage can be present in an earlier ancestor's fossils.
