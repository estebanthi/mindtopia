# Ask
---
The **ask** is the price at which your broker will _sell_ the base currency in exchange for the quote currency.

This means the ask price is the best available price at which you can buy from the market.

Another word for ask is the **offer price.**

If you want to buy something, the broker will sell (or offer) it to you at the **ask** price.
