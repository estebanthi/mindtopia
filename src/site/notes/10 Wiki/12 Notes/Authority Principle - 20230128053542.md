# Authority Principle
---
The authority principle, also known as the authority bias, is a [[10 Wiki/13 Plantations/Cognitive Bias - 20230221095209\|Cognitive Bias - 20230221095209]] in which people tend to obey authority figures without question.

This can occur because people tend to associate authority figures with expertise and knowledge, and therefore assume that they know what is best.

The authority principle can be seen in a variety of situations, such as in the workplace, where employees may blindly follow the orders of their superiors, or in medical settings, where patients may accept the diagnosis and treatment plan of their doctor without question. The principle can also be seen in more extreme forms, such as in the case of abusive cult leaders who exert extreme control over their followers.
