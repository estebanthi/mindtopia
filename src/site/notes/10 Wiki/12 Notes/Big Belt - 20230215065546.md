Big belts are [[Belt Passing\|Belt Passing]]. They print on a zone. It's better to trade them on a daily chart. Stop loss is placed beyond the belt, and take profit on the next zone.

## Trading big belts
- The bullish big belt must have an opening price near the low of the candlestick, and it must also have a closing price near the high of the candlestick.
- The big belt candlestick must print on a zone.
