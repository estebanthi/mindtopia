# 3 Bar Play
---
It's a [[10 Wiki/13 Plantations/Candlestick Pattern - 20230221094146\|Candlestick Pattern - 20230221094146]] consisting of 3 or 4 candlesticks, sometimes 5.

1. The first bar needs to be an “igniting” bar — a very wide range candle, ideally on high volume.
2. The [[Pullback\|Pullback]] bar, or bar 2 (& 3), must not exceed 50% retracement of the 1st bar and have relatively equal highs.
3. The trigger bar (or expansion candle) should also be a nice [[Marubozu\|Marubozu]] to new highs or lows.

Entry is taken on the break of the smaller “inside candles” with a stop below them.

The best scenario for these setups is as a continuation pattern.

**Keep in mind, that the “pause” candle can be red or green, it doesn’t really matter**. The important thing is that it doesn’t retrace too much of the first candle and forms near the top of that candle.

## Take profit
The take profit is placed according to [[Risk-Reward Ratio\|Risk-Reward Ratio]] calculation. We can also use [[Zone\|Zones]].
