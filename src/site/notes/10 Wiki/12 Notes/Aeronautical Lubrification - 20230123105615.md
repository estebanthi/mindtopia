# Aeronautical Lubrification
---
Aeronautical lubrification is used for many reasons:
- Reduce friction between parts to reduce wear and heating
- Cool the engine with the calories provided by the oil
- Evacuate impurities through the oil filter

To ensure a good lubrification, we must always check the oil level during [[Pre-Flight\|Pre-Flight]].

## Circuit
The oil is taken from the crankcase by the oil pump and is directed to the points to be lubricated by the oil filter and the oil lines.

## Instruments
There are some ways to know whether the lubrification is done correctly or not:
- Oil temperature
- Oil pressure

## Anomalies
- **Oil pressure too low** => bad lubrication or bad pressure gauge. Reduce the power: if it rises, it is a **lubrication** problem, we must ask. Otherwise, pressure gauge problem.
- **Oil pressure too high** => reduce power and land as soon as possible.
