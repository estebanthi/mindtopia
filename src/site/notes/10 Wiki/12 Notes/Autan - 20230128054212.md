The autan is a french wind blowing in the south of [[France\|France]]. There are two types of autans:
- The **black autan** is a hot, dry wind that typically blows from the north or northwest, and is associated with high temperatures and low humidity. It is called "black" because it is said to darken the sky and bring a sense of oppressive heat.
- The **white autan** on the other hand, is a cool, moist wind that typically blows from the northwest or west. It is called "white" because it is said to bring a sense of freshness and clarity to the air, and to clear the sky of any clouds.

Both the black autan and white autan are known to be unpredictable and can change quickly, bringing unexpected weather conditions. They are more common in the summer months and can cause [[Heatwave\|Heatwaves]] and wildfires.

These winds are specific to the south of France and the Mediterranean area, and may not be known by the same names in other regions.
