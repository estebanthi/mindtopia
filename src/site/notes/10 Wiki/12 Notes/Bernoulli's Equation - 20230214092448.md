# Bernoulli's Equation
---
Bernoulli's equation is a fundamental equation in fluid dynamics that relates the pressure, velocity, and elevation of a fluid flowing through a system. It is based on the principle of conservation of energy and is named after the Swiss mathematician and physicist, Daniel Bernoulli.

The Bernoulli's equation can be written as:
$$P + 1/2 ρ v^2 + ρ g h = constant$$

Where:
- P is the pressure of the fluid
- ρ is the density of the fluid
- v is the velocity of the fluid
- g is the acceleration due to gravity
- h is the height of the fluid above a reference plane.

This equation states that the total energy of the fluid (sum of pressure, kinetic energy and potential energy) remains constant along a streamline in a steady flow of an ideal fluid with no viscosity or heat transfer.

The Bernoulli's equation has many applications in [[100 Zettelkasten/120 MOC/Fluid Mechanics\|Fluid Mechanics]], including in the design of [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aircraft - 20230125033243\|Aircraft]] wings, pipes, and turbines, and it can be used to understand the behavior of fluids in many different scenarios.
