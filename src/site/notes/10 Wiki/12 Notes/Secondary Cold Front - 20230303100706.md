# Secondary Cold Front
---
A secondary cold front, also known as a reinforcing cold front, is a second [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Cold Front - 20230303100453\|Cold Front]] that follows closely behind the initial cold front. The term "secondary" is used because it is a subsequent front that reinforces the effects of the first front.

When a secondary cold front follows an initial cold front, it can bring additional cold air into the region, causing temperatures to drop further. It can also enhance the precipitation associated with the first front, leading to additional showers or thunderstorms. The passage of a secondary cold front can also cause the winds to shift and become gustier, and the air pressure to rise more abruptly than with the initial cold front.

The effects of a secondary cold front can be more pronounced than the initial front, especially if it is a strong front. This is because the initial cold front has already cooled the air and destabilized the atmosphere, making it more susceptible to additional cooling and precipitation from the secondary front. The occurrence of a secondary cold front is more common in the fall and winter months, when the contrast between warm and cold air masses is greatest.
