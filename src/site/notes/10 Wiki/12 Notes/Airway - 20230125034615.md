# Airway

An airway is a designated corridor in the airspace that is used by [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aircraft - 20230125033243\|Aircrafts]] to fly between two points, such as airports or navigation aids.

It is defined by a series of radio beacons or navigation points, and is typically assigned a specific altitude range. 

Airways are used by [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aircraft - 20230125033243\|Aircrafts]] flying under [[Instrument Flight Rules\|Instrument Flight Rules]] in order to ensure safe separation from other aircraft and to provide a direct route for the aircraft to fly.

Airway allows aircrafts flying under IFR to follow a specific route without the need for the pilot to constantly navigate by visual reference to the ground.

Airways also allows the air traffic control to manage the flow of aircraft efficiently and reduce the risk of collisions. Some airways are used by both IFR and [[Visual Flight Rules\|Visual Flight Rules]] (VFR) aircraft, while others are restricted to IFR traffic only.
