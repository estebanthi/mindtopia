# Artificial Intelligence
---
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems.

These processes include learning (the ability to improve with experience), reasoning (the ability to draw conclusions from available data), and self-correction.

AI technology has advanced significantly in recent years, and it is now possible to create systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

There are two main branches of AI research: narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform a specific task and strong AI, which is a machine with general intelligence, the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human being can.
