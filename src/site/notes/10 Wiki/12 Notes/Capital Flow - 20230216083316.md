# Capital Flow
---
**Capital flows measure the amount of money flowing into and out of a country or economy because of capital investment purchasing and selling.**

When a country has a **positive capital flow balance**, foreign investments coming into the country are greater than investments heading out of the country.

A **negative capital flow balance** is the direct opposite. Investments leaving the country for some foreign destinations are greater than investments coming in.

With more investment coming into a country, demand increases for that country’s currency as foreign investors have to sell their currency in order to buy the local currency. This demand causes the currency to increase in value.
