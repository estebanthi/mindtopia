# Bar Chart
---
Bar charts in trading are a type of financial chart that represent the price movement of an asset over a specific period of time.

They display the opening price, closing price, highest and lowest price, and volume of an asset as rectangular bars.


## When to Use Bar Charts?
Bar charts are preferred over other charts, such as line charts or candlestick charts, when traders are interested in seeing the overall price movement, rather than just the trend. They are useful for analyzing price trends, and help traders make informed decisions when buying or selling assets.
