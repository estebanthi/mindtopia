# Compilation
---
Compilation is the process of converting source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer. The machine code is a low-level, binary representation of the program that can be directly executed by the computer's processor.

In the compilation process, the source code is transformed by a compiler into an executable file that can be run on a specific operating system and architecture. The compiler performs various tasks such as syntax checking, type checking, code optimization, and code generation to produce the final machine code.

Compilation is a necessary step in the software development process because the source code, which is written in a high-level programming language, cannot be executed directly by the computer's processor. The compiler serves as a bridge between the high-level language and the low-level machine code, allowing developers to write code in a more abstract, human-readable form and then convert it into a form that can be executed by the computer.


## Command
```
gcc â€“c source.c -o output.o
