# 4 Cs
---
4 Cs is a [[10 Wiki/13 Plantations/Memory - 20230221103059\|Memory - 20230221103059]] principle to remember names.

## Concentrate
You have to be focus on the name of the person talking to you.

## Create
You have to create an image for the name in your mind, to be able to re-create it later.

When you are introduced to someone, you only have twenty seconds to think about the name and make an association. If you don’t do anything with the name in twenty seconds the name will be gone. The more connections and meaning you can give the name, the more it will ‘stick.

## Connect
All learning is creating a relationship between the known and the unknown.

You will already know the face so you need to connect the unknown name to the known face. When you see the face it must act as a trigger or peg to bring the name to your awareness.

## Continuous Use
If you concentrate and get the name, then make it meaningful and connect it to the person, then this will enable you to remember the name for the short-term. However, to make the name stick in your memory forever you have to continue using it.
