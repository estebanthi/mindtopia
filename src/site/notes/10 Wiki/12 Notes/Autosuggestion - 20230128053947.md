# Autosuggestion
---
Autosuggestion is the process of suggesting or influencing one's own thoughts, feelings, or behavior through self-talk or affirmations. It is a form of self-induced suggestion that can be used to change one's subconscious mind and influence one's own thoughts, emotions, and actions.

Autosuggestion is based on the idea that the mind can be influenced through the use of positive affirmations and visualization techniques. The goal of autosuggestion is to reprogram the mind with positive thoughts and beliefs, so that one can achieve specific goals or overcome negative habits or thoughts.

It is often used as a technique for self-improvement, such as for increasing self-confidence, overcoming fears, or achieving specific goals. Autosuggestion can be done by repeating positive affirmations to oneself, visualizing a desired outcome, or writing down one's goals.

It is also been used in therapy, hypnotherapy and psychoanalysis to help people overcome negative thoughts and behaviours.
