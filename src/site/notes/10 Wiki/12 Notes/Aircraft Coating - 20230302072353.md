# Aircraft Coating
---
Aeronautical coating, also known as [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aircraft - 20230125033243\|Aircraft]] coating, is a type of specialized coating used on the exterior and interior surfaces of aircraft to protect against environmental factors such as UV radiation, moisture, and corrosive substances. Aeronautical coatings are specifically designed to meet the high performance and safety requirements of the aviation industry.

Aircraft coatings are typically applied in multiple layers, with each layer serving a specific purpose. The base layer provides adhesion and corrosion resistance, while the top layer provides protection against UV radiation and weathering. Some aircraft coatings also contain special additives to improve their durability, abrasion resistance, and fire retardant properties.

In addition to their protective function, aeronautical coatings are also used for aesthetic purposes. Many aircraft coatings are available in a variety of colors and finishes, which can be used to create a distinctive appearance and branding for the airline.

Aeronautical coatings must meet strict regulations and standards set by aviation authorities such as the [[Federal Aviation Administration\|Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) and the [[European Aviation Safety Agency\|European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA). These regulations cover factors such as flammability, toxicity, and environmental impact. Aeronautical coatings are subject to rigorous testing and certification before they can be used on aircraft.
