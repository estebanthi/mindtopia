# Average True Range
---
The Average True Range (ATR) is a [[100 Zettelkasten/120 MOC/Technical Indicators\|Technical Indicator]] used in [[100 Zettelkasten/Technical Analysis\|Technical Analysis]] to measure the [[100 Zettelkasten/Volatility\|Volatility]] of a financial instrument, such as a stock, commodity or currency. It is typically used to identify the overall level of market [[100 Zettelkasten/Volatility\|Volatility]] and to assess the potential for price movements in the future.

The ATR is calculated by taking the average of the true range over a specified number of periods. The true range is the greatest of the following:

-   The current high minus the current low
-   The absolute value of the current high minus the previous close
-   The absolute value of the current low minus the previous close

The ATR is then typically smoothed using a moving average to reduce the impact of short-term [[100 Zettelkasten/Volatility\|Volatility]] on the indicator. The resulting value is the average true range.

The ATR is typically plotted as a line on a chart, and its value is given in the same units as the price of the financial instrument being analyzed. A higher ATR value indicates higher [[100 Zettelkasten/Volatility\|Volatility]], while a lower ATR value indicates lower [[100 Zettelkasten/Volatility\|Volatility]].

The ATR can be used in different ways, such as to set stop-loss and profit-taking levels, to identify potential [[100 Zettelkasten/Breakout\|Breakouts]], and to confirm trends.
