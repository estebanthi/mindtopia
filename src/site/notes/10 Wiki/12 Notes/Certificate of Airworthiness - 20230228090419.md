# Certificate of Airworthiness
---
A Certificate of Airworthiness (CofA) is a legal document issued by the civil aviation authorities of a country to certify that an aircraft meets the minimum safety standards required for flight. The CofA is issued after a thorough inspection of the aircraft, including its design, construction, equipment, and maintenance records.

The CofA is an important document that must be carried on board the aircraft at all times. It shows that the aircraft has been tested and inspected by qualified aviation professionals and found to be in compliance with the airworthiness requirements. The certificate also indicates the limitations under which the aircraft can operate, such as the maximum weight, speed, altitude, and other factors that affect its performance.

The CofA is valid for a specific period, which varies depending on the type and intended use of the aircraft. The renewal of the CofA requires the submission of the aircraft maintenance records and a thorough inspection by a qualified aviation inspector.

The Certificate of Airworthiness is a critical requirement for ensuring the safety of air travel. Without it, an aircraft cannot legally operate in the airspace of a country or international routes governed by international aviation regulations.
