# Aeronautical Anti-Icing Systems
---
Anti-icing systems for aircrafts are designed to prevent the formation of ice on the surfaces of the aircraft, such as the wings, tail, and engines, which can cause a reduction in [[100 Zettelkasten/Lift\|Lift]], increase [[100 Zettelkasten/Drag\|Drag]] and affect the control of the aircraft. The main types of anti-icing systems are:
- Pneumatic boot de-icing - This type of system uses inflatable rubber boots on the leading edges of the wings and tail surfaces. When the system is activated, the boots inflate and deflate rapidly, breaking off any ice that has formed on the surfaces.
- Electrical heating - This type of system uses electrical heating elements embedded in the leading edges of the wings and tail surfaces. The heating elements are powered by the aircraft's electrical system and are used to melt any ice that has formed on the surfaces.
- Hot air - This type of system uses hot air from the aircraft's engines to heat the wing and tail surfaces. The hot air is directed to the surfaces through ducts and nozzles, and is used to melt any ice that has formed on the surfaces.
- Chemical de-icing - This type of system uses chemicals, such as glycol, to prevent the formation of ice on the surfaces of the aircraft. The chemicals are applied to the surfaces before flight
