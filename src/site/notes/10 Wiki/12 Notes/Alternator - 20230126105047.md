# Alternator
---
An alternator is a type of electrical generator that converts mechanical energy into [[Alternating Current\|Alternating Current]] (AC) electrical energy. It is typically used in automobiles, trucks and buses as well as in boats and other vehicles.

An alternator is driven by a belt connected to the engine's crankshaft, which turns a rotor inside a stator to generate AC power.

The alternator is designed to provide power to the vehicle's electrical system and charge the [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Battery - 20230129064209\|Battery - 20230129064209]] while the [[Engine\|Engine]] is running. It typically includes a set of diodes that convert the AC power to direct current (DC) power for use by the vehicle's electrical system, and a voltage regulator that maintains a consistent voltage output.
