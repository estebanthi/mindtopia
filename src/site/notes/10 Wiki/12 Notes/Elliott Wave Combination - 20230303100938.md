# Elliott Combination
---
An Elliott Wave combination is a complex corrective pattern that occurs in financial markets, named after its discoverer, Ralph Nelson Elliott. It is a combination of two or three corrective waves that unfold in a specific manner.

In an Elliott Wave combination, the first corrective wave is typically a simple [[100 Zettelkasten/Zigzag\|Zigzag]] or [[100 Zettelkasten/Flat\|Flat]] pattern. It is followed by a more complex wave that consists of two or three smaller corrective waves. This wave can be a zigzag, flat, or [[100 Zettelkasten/Triangle\|Triangle]] pattern. The second corrective wave can take the form of a double or triple combination.

The third and final corrective wave in an Elliott Wave combination is usually a simple zigzag or flat pattern that corrects the entire correction. This final wave is typically in the direction of the previous trend, indicating that the correction is complete and the trend is set to resume.

Elliott Wave combinations can occur in any time frame, from intraday charts to monthly charts, and in any financial market.
