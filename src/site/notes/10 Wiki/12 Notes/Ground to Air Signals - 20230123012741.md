# Ground to Air Signals
---
Ground to air signals are used when an [[100 Zettelkasten/Aircraft\|Aircraft]] crashes and people survive, to communicate with eventual [[100 Zettelkasten/Aircraft\|Aircrafts]] flying over the zone.

Here are the signals to know:
- V: request assistance.
- X: request medical assistance.
- N: no.
- Y: yes.
- Arrow: we are heading in this direction.
