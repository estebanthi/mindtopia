# Controlled Flight Into Terrain
---
A controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) is an aviation accident that occurs when an aircraft, under the control of the pilot, inadvertently flies into the ground, a mountain, or an obstacle. CFIT accidents often occur during poor visibility conditions, such as in fog, rain, or low clouds, or in areas with challenging terrain.

CFIT accidents typically occur when pilots lose situational awareness, meaning they become disoriented or confused about the aircraft's position or altitude in relation to the surrounding terrain. This can happen for several reasons, including equipment malfunctions, communication errors, or incorrect navigation.

CFIT accidents can be particularly devastating because they usually occur at high speed and without any warning, leaving little or no time for the pilots to react. Many CFIT accidents result in fatalities, and they remain a significant challenge for aviation safety.
