# C++
---
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the [[C\|C]] programming language. It was created in the early 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs as an object-oriented programming language that could be used to write efficient, low-level programs for systems programming, as well as high-level applications with complex data structures and algorithms.

C++ is known for its flexibility, performance, and versatility, and is used in a wide range of applications, including operating systems, video games, scientific computing, finance, and more. It supports a wide range of programming paradigms, including object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming, and includes features such as classes, templates, exception handling, and memory management.

One of the key features of C++ is its ability to provide both high-level and low-level programming constructs, making it well-suited for both application development and system-level programming. However, this flexibility also means that C++ can be more complex and difficult to learn than some other programming languages.

C++ is widely used and has a large community of developers and libraries, making it a popular choice for developing high-performance, complex applications in a variety of fields.


## Why Learn C++?
- Faster than [[100 Zettelkasten/Python\|Python]] (compilation and static types)
- Better control
- Higher abstraction
