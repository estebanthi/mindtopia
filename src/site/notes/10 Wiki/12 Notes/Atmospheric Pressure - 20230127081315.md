# Atmospheric Pressure
---
Atmospheric pressure, also known as barometric pressure, is the force exerted on the [[100 Zettelkasten/Earth\|Earth]]'s surface by the weight of the atmosphere.

It is measured in units of force per unit area, such as pascals (Pa) or pounds per square inch (psi).

The average atmospheric pressure at sea level on Earth is approximately 1013 hPa (hectopascals) or 101.3 kPa (kilopascals), which is equivalent to 14.7 psi. This value can vary depending on factors such as altitude, weather, and latitude. At higher altitudes, there is less atmospheric mass above, so the pressure is lower. In addition, weather systems can cause changes in pressure, with high pressure systems associated with clear, dry weather, and low pressure systems associated with storms and precipitation.

## Variation with Altitude
The variation of pressure with altitude is not linear but for low level flights, it is considered that 1 hPa is lost every 28 ft.
