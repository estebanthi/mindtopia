# Attitude
---
The attitude of a [[Plane\|Plane]] refers to the orientation of the [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aircraft - 20230125033243\|Aircraft]] in relation to the horizon. It includes the pitch, roll, and yaw of the aircraft. Pitch refers to the angle at which the nose of the aircraft is pointing up or down, roll refers to the rotation of the aircraft around its longitudinal axis, and yaw refers to the rotation of the aircraft around its vertical axis.

The pilot uses the aircraft's control surfaces, such as the [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aileron - 20230124103842\|Ailerons]] and [[100 Zettelkasten/Rudder\|Rudder]], to adjust the attitude of the plane during flight.
