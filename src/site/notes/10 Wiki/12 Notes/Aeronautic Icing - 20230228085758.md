# Aeronautic Icing
---
Airframe icing is caused by supercooled water droplets icing on the parts most exposed to the relative wind.

This phenomenon is very present between -15째C and 0째C, and is all the more present the larger the drops are.

Below -30째C, there are only ice crystals which are not dangerous because they do not stick.


## Different Types of Icing
- [[Glaze\|Glaze]]
- [[100 Zettelkasten/Opaque Frost\|Opaque Frost]]
- [[White Frost\|White Frost]]


## Protecting Yourself from Icing
The most sensitive parts of the [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aircraft - 20230125033243\|Aircraft - 20230125033243]] (windshield, leading edges, antenna, air inlets, [[Pitot Tube\|Pitot Tube]]) are equipped with systems to break or prevent icing.

## Risk Areas
Avoid passing near frontal surfaces, as rain is supercooled there and the passage of an [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aircraft - 20230125033243\|Aircraft - 20230125033243]] can cause icing.

It is also important to avoid passing above the 0째C isotherm, and to be aware of the [[Cloud\|Cloud]]s at risk and their thickness.


## Flying in Icy Conditions
In general, passenger aircraft are not suitable for flying in such conditions.

However, even an aircraft that is equipped with them may not be able to fly in these conditions because it must be able to maintain performance even if the icing protection systems fail.
