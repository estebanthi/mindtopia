# Adapter
---
The Adapter pattern is a [[Design Pattern\|Design Pattern]] that allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

It has an interface that is compatible with that of one of the existing objects, and will rewrite the object's methods by calling those of the other object.

Ideally, the Adapter should inherit from both classes it wishes to adapt, but this is not possible in some languages.


## Applications
- We want to use a class, but the interface is incompatible with our code.
- We want to reuse subclasses that lack functionality, but whose functionality cannot be implemented in the superclass.
