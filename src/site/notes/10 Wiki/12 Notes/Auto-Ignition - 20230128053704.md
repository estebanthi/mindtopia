# Auto-Ignition
---
Auto-ignition, also known as spontaneous ignition or self-ignition, is the phenomenon in which an [[Engine\|Engine]] combusts fuel without the aid of a spark from the spark plug.

This can occur in internal combustion engines, particularly diesel engines, when the compression of the air in the cylinder becomes high enough to cause the fuel to ignite.

The compression ratio of a diesel engine is much higher than that of a gasoline engine, and this increased compression causes the fuel to heat up and ignite on its own.

Auto-ignition occurs at a higher temperature than ignition from spark plugs. Auto-ignition can cause engine damage if the timing of the fuel injection is not correctly set.
