# Aerodyne
---
An aerodyne is a type of aircraft that uses [[Airfoil\|Airfoils]] and rotors to generate [[100 Zettelkasten/Lift\|Lift]] by creating an aerodynamic force.

It is powered by either an internal combustion engine or electric motor. The aircraft utilizes a combination of [[Thrust\|Thrust]] and [[100 Zettelkasten/Lift\|Lift]] to fly and often has a lower payload capacity than a traditional aircraft.

Aerodynes can be used in many different applications, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, helicopters, or even passenger aircraft. They are usually more efficient and maneuverable than traditional aircraft, making them an ideal choice for many applications.
