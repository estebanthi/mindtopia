# Ammeter
---
An ammeter is an electrical instrument that is used to measure the electric current in a circuit. It is connected in series with the circuit, meaning that the current flowing through the circuit must also flow through the ammeter. The ammeter has a low internal [[Resistance\|Resistance]], which minimizes any effect it has on the circuit and ensures that the current being measured is as accurate as possible.

An ammeter is typically a type of analog meter that has a moving pointer that indicates the current on a calibrated scale. The scale is usually marked in amperes (A), which is the unit of measurement for electric current. Some ammeters can be digital, which displays the current in numerical form on an LED or LCD screen.
