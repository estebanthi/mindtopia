# Alpha Particle
---
An alpha particle is a type of ionized atomic nucleus consisting of two [[100 Zettelkasten/Proton\|Protons]] and two [[100 Zettelkasten/Neutron\|Neutrons]], which is identical to the nucleus of a helium-4 atom.

Alpha particles are emitted by some types of radioactive materials during [[Alpha Decay\|Alpha Decay]].

They are relatively large and heavy, and have a positive charge, which makes them strongly ionizing and highly damaging to living tissue when they are emitted from radioactive materials.

Due to their large size and charge, alpha particles are not able to penetrate very far through matter and can be stopped by a sheet of paper or a few centimeters of air.
