# Dark Cloud Cover
---
In [[10 Wiki/13 Plantations/Technical Analysis - 20230221094216\|Technical Analysis - 20230221094216]] of financial markets, a dark cloud cover is a bearish [[10 Wiki/13 Plantations/Candlestick Pattern - 20230221094146\|Candlestick Pattern - 20230221094146]] that can indicate a potential reversal in price trend. The pattern occurs when a long white or green candle is followed by a long black or red candle that opens above the previous day's high and closes below the midpoint of the first candle's real body.

The pattern is called a dark cloud cover because the black or red candle "covers" or overshadows the previous day's white or green candle, suggesting a shift in market sentiment from bullish to bearish. The pattern is often seen as a warning sign for traders who are long on a stock or other asset, as it suggests that the uptrend may be losing momentum and that the bears may be taking control.
