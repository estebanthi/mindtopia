# Association Principle
---
The association principle is a [[Cognitive Bias\|Cognitive Bias]]. The principle is that we give attributes to things because of the context.

## Examples
Why are there models in car ads? Because the advertiser expects you to think the car has the qualities of the model: beauty and seduction.

For the same reason, we see a lot of actors or comedians in ads. No one cares about the link between the actor and the product, as long as it is positive.
