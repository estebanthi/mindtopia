# Airworthiness Review Certificate
---
An Airworthiness Review Certificate (ARC) is a document issued by a government aviation authority, such as the [[Federal Aviation Administration\|Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) in the United States, that certifies that an aircraft is in compliance with the applicable airworthiness regulations and is safe to operate.

The ARC is issued after a thorough review of the [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aircraft - 20230125033243\|Aircraft]]'s maintenance records, inspection, and testing. It is required for aircraft that are not operated under a standard airworthiness certificate, such as an aircraft that is imported from another country, an aircraft that has been rebuilt or modified, or an aircraft that has been in storage for an extended period of time.

The process of obtaining an ARC includes an inspection of the aircraft and its records by an authorized representative of the aviation authority, such as a [[Designated Airworthiness Representative\|Designated Airworthiness Representative]] (DAR). The inspection will include a review of the aircraft's maintenance records, a physical inspection of the aircraft to ensure compliance with the regulations, and a test flight if necessary.

Once the aircraft is found to be in compliance with the regulations, the aviation authority will issue an ARC, which must be kept on board the aircraft at all times. The ARC must be renewed periodically, typically every year, to ensure that the aircraft continues to comply with the regulations and is safe to operate.
