# Aeronautical Fuel System
---
Consists of :
- **Tanks**: containing [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aeronautical Fuel - 20230123104034\|Aeronautical Fuel]], located in the wings or fuselage. Equipped with a float to inform the pilot of the fuel level.
- **Selector valve**: allows the pilot to choose the tanks to be used.
- **Decanter Filter**: allows purging at the low point of the engine.
- **Auxiliary Electric Pump**: emergency pump to replace the main pump, used as a preventive measure during take-off and landing, when the diagnosis of a main pump failure is impossible.
- **Mechanical Pump**: main pump supplying the engine.
- **Pressure Indicator**: provides information on the pressure in the system. A drop in pressure can occur in certain cases: empty tank, closed valve, broken mechanical pump, indicator out of order. In the event of a drop in pressure, the electric pump should be switched on immediately and the tank changed.

## Notes
- High wing aircraft do not have a pump, and are gravity fed.
- During the pre-flight inspection, the fuel level is checked.
- During the flight, the tanks are changed every 30 minutes to balance the tanks, and the fuselage tanks are emptied first.
