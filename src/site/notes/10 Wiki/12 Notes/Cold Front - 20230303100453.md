# Cold Front
---
A cold front is a boundary between two air masses where a cooler, denser air mass replaces a warmer, less dense air mass. When a cold front moves into a region, it typically brings about a change in weather conditions, such as cooler temperatures, gusty winds, and precipitation. 

The precipitation can be heavy at times, often taking the form of thunderstorms, as the colder air pushes the warm, moist air upward, causing it to cool and condense into clouds. The passage of a cold front is usually marked by a distinct shift in wind direction, a drop in temperature, and a decrease in humidity.

Cold fronts can be associated with extreme weather conditions, such as tornadoes, hailstorms, and blizzards, depending on the time of year and the location.

They are represented by a blue triangle on maps.

Sometimes, a cold front can be followed by a [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Secondary Cold Front - 20230303100706\|Secondary Cold Front]].
