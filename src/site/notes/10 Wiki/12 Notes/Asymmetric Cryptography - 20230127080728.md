# Asymmetric Cryptography
---
Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, is a method of encrypting and decrypting data using a pair of keys: a public key and a private key.

The public key is used to encrypt the data, and the private key is used to decrypt it. The keys are mathematically related, but it is computationally infeasible to determine one key based on the other.

This allows for secure communication because a message can be encrypted using the recipient's public key, but can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key. Additionally, digital signatures can be created using the private key, and verified using the public key. This ensures the authenticity of the message, and non-repudiation.
