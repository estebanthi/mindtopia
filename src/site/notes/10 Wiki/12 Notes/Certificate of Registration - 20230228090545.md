It provides proof of ownership and identifies the owner or operator of the vehicle or vessel.

The certificate typically includes information such as the make, model, year, and identification number of the vehicle, as well as the name and address of the registered owner.

The Certificate of Registration is an important document that must be carried on board the vehicle or vessel at all times. It serves as proof of ownership and registration, and can be used to establish legal rights in case of disputes or accidents.

The process of obtaining a Certificate of Registration varies depending on the type of vehicle or vessel and the country or state where it is registered. Generally, it involves submitting an application and providing proof of ownership, such as a bill of sale or title. The application may also require payment of registration fees and compliance with various safety and environmental regulations.
