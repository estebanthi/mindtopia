# Venturi Pneumatic Circuit
---
The [[Venturi\|Venturi]] pneumatic circuit is a [[10 Wiki/12 Notes/Aeronautical Pneumatic Circuit - 20230124101652\|Aeronautical Pneumatic Circuit]] using a [[Venturi\|Venturi]] instead of a [[Vacuum Pump\|Vacuum Pump]].

The air is accelerated through a venturi tube, creating a vacuum at the neck which will suck the air out and create a vacuum in the system.

Gyro valves are used to isolate each instrument from the circuit.

## Drawbacks
The venturi tube has two drawbacks:
- Does not work well in taxiing
- Very sensitive to [[Airframe Icing\|Airframe Icing]]
