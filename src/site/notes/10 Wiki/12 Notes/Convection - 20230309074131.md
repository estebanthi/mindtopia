# Convection
---
Convection is the transfer of heat energy by the movement of fluids (liquids or gases) due to differences in density. When a fluid is heated, it expands and becomes less dense, causing it to rise. As the heated fluid rises, cooler, denser fluid moves in to take its place, creating a circular flow of fluid known as a convection current.

Convection is a natural process that can be observed in a variety of everyday phenomena, such as the rising of hot air or the circulation of water in a pot as it is heated on a stove. It is also an important mechanism in weather patterns and the Earth's climate system, as warm air rises and cool air sinks, causing changes in atmospheric pressure and creating winds.

Convection can also be used as a method of heat transfer in industrial and engineering applications, such as in cooling systems, heating systems, and heat exchangers. Convection is an efficient method of heat transfer, as it allows for large amounts of energy to be transferred quickly and continuously over large distances.
