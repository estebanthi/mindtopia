# Aeronautic Carburettor
---
The carburettor ensures the mixing of petrol and air.

[[Gasoline\|Gasoline]] is fed to the **tank** by the pump. Level is maintained constant with a **float**.
The petrol then circulates to the **gicleur**.

The air is set in motion by the descent of the intake piston, and is accelerated in a [[Venturi\|Venturi]] to spray the petrol in fine droplets by vacuum.
