## What the book is about

If you follow me, you probably know what is lucid dreaming. This is exactly what this book is about.

This book from Michael Raduga (a researcher specialized in Out of Body Experiences) is about all the kinds of experiences like lucid dreams such as:

-   Out of Body Experience
-   Astral Projection

Raduga groups all these experiences under a common term: “**The phase**”.

The phase is a special state of consciousness where you are detached from your physical body and you can do whatever you want.

> Wait, WTF is that?!

It can sound amazing, and it is. But there is nothing paranormal or esoteric in this. The phase is created by your brain. But honestly, don’t know really how to describe the phase. The best thing you can do is try to experience it yourself because it’s not really describable.

In a few words, and the book will confirm it, it’s a state where you’re conscious while you’re sleeping, so it allows you to do whatever you want because it is as if you were in a dream. And what is nice is that you can feel the sensations as if they were real.

The book will teach you how to reach this state in a few days. It will also teach you some skills useful when you’re in the phase as creating the vision, teleporting, making objects appear, etc…

The pedagogy is well present in this book because at the end of each chapter a questionnaire will be proposed to you to see if you have well understood what it is about.

There is also a part dedicated to people who are close to mastering the phase.

## My thoughts

I liked this book. I already knew a lot of things, but it was still useful. And I guess for a complete beginner in this field, this book can be really good.

But I think it’s a little bit optimistic. It says you can experience the phase in just some days. I tried for 3 days and the techniques in this book have not yet worked completely (they worked a little). I’m sure in a few days these techniques will have worked, but it’s lying to say you can experience it in just a few days, especially if you’re a beginner.

Also, there is a lot of repetition in the book. There are some pages I read very fast because it was already told elsewhere. I guess this is part of the pedagogy, a lot of repetition to make it easier for readers to remember what is told.

Overall, the book was good and well-structured. I especially liked the end because it is a summary of all the techniques.

I also liked another aspect of the book, it is written to motivate you (perhaps it’s part of the pedagogy too). It talks about why you should experience the phase and what are its benefits.

## Who should read it

If you want to begin with lucid dreams experiences and the phase, this book is really good for you. It will teach you some basics and some techniques you can start to practice now.

If you have already had some phase experiences, you can still read this book as it will teach you how to go more in-depth, like how to stabilize the phase, how to do whatever you want, etc…

This book is just useless for the people who master the phase, but I guess no one masters this hehe.
