Are you a Python developer interested in data science? You surely have already heard about Scikit-learn. This book will guide you through this wonderful package.

Machine Learning consists of a compilation of already known algorithms to solve problems. Scikit-learn is a Python package implementing these algorithms, and a lot of utils to solve data science problems. But, every problem is different and you must adapt your knowledge to solve them. This book is a great book to discover the most popular machine learning algorithms and their use through scikit-learn.

You will discover machine learning through real situations with the corresponding code to solve the problem. I liked this approach of working with examples as programming is a lot abstract and sometimes programming in books may be hard to understand. So examples are a must in a book whose purpose is to teach you a package.

Also, there is a lot of variety in the problems encountered in this book. You will learn how to deal with simple problems and more complex problems like text processing or image processing problems.

One thing: if you already know machine learning and you just want to learn how to implement it in Python, you will skip a lot of pages. This book targets essentially beginners. There is a whole part about what is data science and what problem types you may encounter. There is also a part about data preprocessing. And in every scikit-learn algorithm’s implementation, the theory behind the algorithm is detailed. For me, I already known a lot of things so I skip these parts, but for complete beginners, it is very useful as you don’t have to buy another book to learn the basics.

## Final Thought

This book is a good book if you want to learn machine learning with Python. It targets complete beginners, but more advanced people will still find it useful as it also explains how to solve complex problems and it completes the scikit-learn’s documentation with real examples.
