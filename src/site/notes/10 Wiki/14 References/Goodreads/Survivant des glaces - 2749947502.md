## Quick Summary

Mike Horn’s last expedition, Pole2Pole, was a crossing from the North Pole to the South Pole, without a motorized vehicle, by ski, kayak and aboard his icebreaking sailboat. This adventure, completed on December 30, 2019, is the most extreme he has accomplished.

In a thrilling story, looking back on this odyssey between the two most opposite points of our globe, he will once again understand that man is very tiny in the face of nature and its dangers, but that for nothing in the world will he give up facing them.

## My Thoughts

If you want to travel a little, dive into this book. It was very interesting and even if the writing and the vocabulary sometimes leave something to be desired, Mike Horn is above all an explorer, not a writer. We can forgive him that.

This book is very easy to read, on the other hand one thing is sometimes a little annoying, it is the fact of always bringing back to his person, with a lot of “me I”. The fact is that Mike Horn wanted to express his opinion about global warming, his mindset, his strength, etc. But this makes the book a little bit committed and personal, which is not necessarily bad, but it’s just not what you expect.

Overall, there’s nothing much to say about this book. This was my first Mike Horn book and I read it very quickly, I must say it makes me want to know about Mike Horn’s other adventures and to read his other books.

I’ve read this book in French. I’m not sure if an English translation exists, I have not found one.

## To Read or Not to Read?

I liked this book, and I think it could have pleased anyone. However, the fact that the book is a bit personal sometimes can be annoying.

If you don’t care knowing the opinions and mindset of Mike Horn, read it, or else it may be unpleasant.
