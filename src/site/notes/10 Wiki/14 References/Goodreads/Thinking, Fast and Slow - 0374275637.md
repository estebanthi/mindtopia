## Quick Summary

Our mind can be represented according to two systems. The first one is fast, intuitive, and emotional. The second is slow but more Cartesian and logical.

Kahneman shows us the extraordinary powers of these two systems, and the biases that are linked to them and that can influence our thoughts.

It also shows how important it is to understand these two systems in order to make better use of your brain.

## My Thoughts

This book is intellectually very interesting, and it is clear that the author knows what he is talking about.

On the other hand, it is terribly long and full of anecdotes used to illustrate the concepts and theories explained. Not that these anecdotes are useless, but almost. Or at least I don’t think it’s necessary to have so many. This results in very long chapters for not much, which can make the understanding complicated or at least a bit confusing.

However, this is the only negative point I can find. Because everything else was really interesting and I liked the approach by examples, which makes it easy to understand what the author is talking about because some sections are quite difficult to understand.

Everything starts with a brief explanation of the two systems that govern our thoughts, and throughout the book, we learn a little more about each of these systems.

This book is not a book that you read and then close. It is a book that we can take the ideas and implement them in our daily lives to become better.

## To Read or Not to Read

This book is perfect for academics in this field. For others, I think this book can avoid you to read many others explaining the same thing.

But let’s be honest, this book is a bit difficult to read. And at the same time, it’s a fascinating book.

I would recommend it, but don’t be afraid to skip some sections or anecdotes that don’t really bring anything to the book.
