## Quick Summary

Design Patterns are reference solutions to a software design problem. There are many of them, but not all are widely used.

This book focuses on the essentials and is very learning-oriented so that you retain what you read and practice.

## My Thoughts

This book does an excellent job of explaining the concept of design patterns and how they can be used to solve common problems in software design.

One thing with Design Patterns is that it’s hard to understand their purpose. Indeed, I have read many books about Design Patterns, and even if the authors try to explain how you can use such and such patterns, it’s still hard to understand. But this one uses real and detailed examples, and a lot of original things such as dialogues between patterns, to help you to understand.

This book is learning-oriented. There are many exercises you can do to learn the patterns. It’s a new way of learning funnier than just learning every pattern by heart. If you already have some knowledge about Design Patterns, you will probably skip the exercises as I’ve done, skipping half of the book. But if you’re completely new to Design Patterns, the exercises may be really interesting.

One thing I was a bit disappointed about is that this book does not cover all the patterns. When we see all the work put in to create so many exercises and examples, it’s obvious that some patterns can’t be covered, but the ones covered are among the easiest to understand.

One last thing, this book is a lot java-oriented. Even if Design Patterns were initially created for Java and C++, some parts are useless if you don’t use Java as this book sometimes talks about very specific things you can do with Java.

## To Read or Not to Read

This book is the Design Patterns book every beginner should start with, as there are a lot of exercises to make you practice. Even if you’re not a beginner, you will still learn things and have a better understanding of Design Patterns by reading this book.

And the best of all is if you program in Java, because this book goes deep into Java for some parts.
