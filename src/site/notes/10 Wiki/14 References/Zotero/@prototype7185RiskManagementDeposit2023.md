# Risk Management + Deposit Ideas
---
This Reddit post shares an interesting [[100 Zettelkasten/Risk Management\|Risk Management]] idea.

If your system is correctly backtested, you may come up with a chart like this for a year:

**x: weeks, y: risk units**

On average, you should be near the yellow line. The idea is to increase risk when you're near the red line and to decrease it when you're near the green line.
