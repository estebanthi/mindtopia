## Quick Summary

In a small isolated ranch in California, its residents will make a strange discovery. After understanding what it is, they will do their best to stop it.

## My Thoughts

Nope is beautiful, neat, and inventive. Peele has reinvented the codes of alien invasion to a degree rarely seen before.

The alien is apparently a flying saucer, the archetype of the genre, but its form and behavior progress with the film, and reveal a fragility mixed with territorial defense mechanisms.

Despite an interesting scenario, the film is sometimes a little unnecessarily long, especially at the beginning. It takes a good half an hour before being in it.

The film is occasionally scary, but for a horror film, we could have hoped for more tension and screamers. Especially since from time to time we are more into satire. The music spoils the scary atmosphere a bit, and the ending is almost laughable.

## Final Thought

Despite some flaws, the film remains interesting and the atmosphere captivating. It combines science fiction and western, all with an alien with animal and territorial behavior. It is original and interesting. I recommend it, especially for science fiction fans.
