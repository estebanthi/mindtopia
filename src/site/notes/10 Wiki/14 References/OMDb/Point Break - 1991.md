## Quick Summary

A gang of bank robbers called the “Ex-Presidents” is wreaking havoc and carrying out a series of robberies.

Johnny Utah, an FBI agent will help Angelo Pappas to investigate them.  
Apparently, the robbers are a bunch of surfers. That’s why Johnny Utah learns to surf in order to infiltrate a surfing community and get closer to the gang.

## My Thoughts

Point Break is a classic that I had never heard of. And yet everyone I’ve talked to about it has loved it.

The direction is beautifully done and there are many impressive scenes in this film. Especially the free fall scenes, or some surfing scenes also very interesting.

The denouement is very well done. It remained in the spiritual tone established since the beginning of the film and is thus perfectly coherent with the whole film, something that has become rare now.

Keanu Reeves, as Johnny Utah, was excellent, and this film is probably the one that revealed his acting talent. Patrick Swayze, playing Bodhi, was also excellent and played both a protagonist and an antagonist brilliantly.

## To Watch or Not to Watch

I can only recommend this film, very well done. I don’t really find any fault with it, except for one or two scenes that are a bit long.

I’m sure you’ll like this movie, whether you like this kind of movie or not!
