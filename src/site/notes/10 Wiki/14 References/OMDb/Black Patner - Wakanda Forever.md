# Black Patner - Wakanda Forever
---
## Quick Summary

Queen Ramonda, Shuri, M’Baku, Okoye, and the Dora Milaje struggle to protect their nation from interference by other world powers after the death of King T’Challa. As the people struggle to move forward, our heroes must unite and enlist the help of mercenaries Nakia and Everett Ross to bring the kingdom of Wakanda into a new era.

But a terrible threat emerges from a kingdom hidden deep in the ocean: Talokan.

## My Thoughts

As the whole world was shocked to learn of the premature death of its interpreter Chadwick Boseman, Wakanda obviously could not escape the deflagration triggered by the disappearance of its king T’Challa aka Black Panther. It is thus logically on a very touching emotion resulting from the sad union between reality and fiction that “Wakanda Forever” opens, bringing us back to the heart of this imaginary kingdom and its inhabitants to share their distress with a sincerity that goes far beyond the framework of an umpteenth superhero movie.

In a final popular tribute, accompanied by the tears of his mother Ramonda and his sister Shuri, unable to turn the page, “Wakanda Forever” closes its painful prologue on a Marvel Studios logo, this time personalized, silent, and announcing a film where the imprint of Chadwick Boseman and his character left on this universe will always be felt…

The tribute was beautifully done. It was solemn, silent, majestic, … It must be said that this opening was rather successful.

On the other hand, the rest of the film was unnecessarily long. Indeed, it was as if the film did not manage to find a balance with the scenario, which results in a rather peculiar pace alternating more intimate, calm and, let’s say it, slow scenes, with more interesting scenes and especially with more action.

This is certainly due to the difficulty of inserting the sad fate of the original Black Panther, forcing to keep throughout the film a certain correlation with the opening.

But the film is not disappointing for all that.

Indeed, first of all, it successfully introduced a new part of the comic book universe: Namor and his underwater world. Whether it is the first assault or the exploration of the Talokan city, the scenes were impressive and successful.

Then, the characters presented were engaging, charismatic for some, and globally all interesting.

Finally, despite its length, the film offers impressive and successful action scenes (even if some fights are not as epic as they could be). The costumes, the special effects, and the music were also very beautiful.

## To Watch or Not to Watch

Even if it is very difficult to forget the interminable and poorly paced side of this film, it is overall quite satisfying and serves as a good movie to go see with family or friends.

I recommend it, but be sure to be in good shape when you watch it so you don’t fall asleep!
