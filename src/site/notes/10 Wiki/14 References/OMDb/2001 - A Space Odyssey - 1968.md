## Quick Summary
After uncovering a mysterious artifact buried beneath the Lunar surface, a spacecraft is sent to Jupiter to find its origins - a spacecraft manned by two men and the supercomputer H.A.L. 9000.

## My Thoughts
"2001: a space odyssey" is really a beautiful and philosophically deep movie.

The realization is on the whole quite special. Indeed, the film is deliberately long. Some shots are a bit strange, repetitive, long, with just music in the background. It evokes a certain poetry.

On the other hand the challenge is to succeed in not falling asleep. Indeed, during 2H30 there are finally very few scenes, very few dialogues.

As for the scenario, it is quite basic, but deeply philosophical, evoking the parallel of evolution on different levels. From ancient apes to artificial intelligence.

In short, this film is quite special. Some will see it as a masterpiece. This is the case on some aspects. On the other hand, the fact that this film is sometimes long and boring is not enough to qualify it as a masterpiece. It is therefore a beautiful and philosophical film rather than a masterpiece.

## To Watch or Not to Watch
This film is one of the films to see. There are some mythical scenes. But be sure to be in shape and have several coffees before seeing it, else you will fall asleep.
