## Quick Summary
The film tells the story of a poor family living in an unsanitary apartment. One day, the son Ki-woo manages to find a job with the very rich Park family and gradually helps his family to get into the Park's big house. But things may not go as planned.

## My Thoughts
Parasite is a remarkable film that is rather unique in its genre. It starts out as a comedy, but as the plot unfolds, it takes unexpected and thrilling turns. Although it is 2 hours and 10 minutes long, the film doesn't feel long thanks to its many twists and turns that are hard to anticipate.

The film offers a powerful social critique, a recurring theme in Bong Joon-ho's filmography. The director highlights the differences between social classes and criticizes a system that forces people to make radical decisions. Several shots are very well done, including squares with stairs that serve as a visual metaphor for this social commentary. As the characters go up and down the stairs, they are filmed in a symmetrical and almost choreographed manner.

At the beginning of the film, the situations are presented in a comical manner. The humor works well, and the con passages are great. As the story progresses, the mood darkens, with slight comic touches still present. The film becomes more and more raw, culminating in scenes of violence. However, the ending is intense and moving, leaving a lasting impact on the audience.

Despite their flaws and often questionable decisions, the characters are engaging, and their actions raise questions of morality. The actors' performances are superb.

The film's direction is exemplary, with beautiful symmetrical shots and impeccable photography. The vastness of the house where most of the events take place is well highlighted, and the different camera angles give the house a soul. The slow-motion sequences are used effectively, with the final scene in the pouring rain being an outstanding example of exceptional direction.

In conclusion, Parasite is a masterpiece with a poignant social critique, a powerful story and superb direction. Bong Joon-ho's Palme d'Or win for this film was well deserved.

## To Watch or Not to Watch?
This movie is a great movie, that will appeal to everyone from start to finish. I highly recommend it.
