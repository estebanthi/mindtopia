## My Thoughts

I recently had the opportunity to watch the movie “Smile,” and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed by the film. From the stunning cinematography and top-notch technical aspects to the compelling plot and well-crafted characters, “Smile” has a lot going for it and is a must-see for fans of horror movies.

The movie follows the story of Dr. Rose Cotter, a clinical psychologist who witnesses a traumatic incident involving a patient and begins to experience frightening events that she cannot explain. As she struggles to confront her troubled past, she finds herself drawn into a horrifying new reality that threatens to consume her.

One of the things that I really appreciated about “Smile” was the way that it tackled the complex and often misunderstood topic of trauma and mental illness. The film does an excellent job of exploring the ways in which these issues can haunt and consume a person, and the way that they can be passed from one person to another. The central hook of the movie, which gives it its name, is a particularly effective and memorable element that ties all of these themes together.

The acting in “Smile” is also top-notch, with Sosie Bacon delivering a standout performance as Dr. Rose Cotter. Bacon does an excellent job of conveying the character’s inner turmoil and struggles, and her portrayal of Cotter’s descent into madness is both convincing and heartbreaking. The supporting cast is also strong, with standout performances from the rest of the cast.

In terms of scares, “Smile” definitely delivers. There are plenty of jump scares and tense moments that kept me on the edge of my seat, and the cinematography and sound design do a great job of creating a sense of unease and dread. While some of the scares may be a little predictable, they are still effective in creating a sense of fear and tension.

## To Watch or Not to Watch?

“Smile” is a must-see for fans of horror movies. It’s a well-made and effective film that explores some deep and important themes, and it boasts strong acting, top-notch technical aspects, and plenty of scares to keep you on the edge of your seat.

If you’re looking for a horror movie that will keep you guessing and make you think, “Smile” is definitely worth checking out.
