## Quick Summary
In an industrial town, Henry Spencer leads an uneventful life, until one day his fianc√©e, Mary, tells him that she had a baby with him and that it is a monster. He marries her, but Mary can't stand the baby's incessant screaming and leaves Henry alone with the child.

During the moments of respite that his son leaves him, Henry begins to dream, in particular of a lady hidden behind the radiator singing a melancholic song...

## My Thoughts
This movie is the strangest I have ever seen. It is disturbing, disgusting, stressful, etc... This was obviously the director's objective, and it is very successful. You will inevitably let out a few grimaces throughout this film.

On the other hand, this film is extremely slow. This is also done on purpose in order to give it a non-linear rhythm, but it is sometimes boring. 

Otherwise the direction is well done, and the shots are well done to disturb us. Henry Spencer in the main role is very good and manages to make us feel this fear sought by the director.

In short, there is not much to say about this film. It seems empty at first sight, no script, no dialogues, very slow, monotonous, and yet it is excellent and has a strong symbolism (I didn't talk about that because I have a hard time interpreting this movie, but you can find a lot of analysis on the Internet).

## To Watch or Not to Watch?
This film is not really mainstream. Few people will like it, it is however a beautiful work. I will recommend it mainly to those who like horror.
