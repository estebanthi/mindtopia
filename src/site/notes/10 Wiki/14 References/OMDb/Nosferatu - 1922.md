## Quick Summary
In 1838, Hutter, a young notary's clerk, goes to conclude a sale with a Carpathian squire. After threatening encounters and ominous omens, he is received by Count Orlock, who is none other than the reincarnation of the vampire Nosferatu, a creature who can only live by sucking the blood of humans.

## My Thoughts
One of the first horror films, and certainly the first silent film I ever watched. I was pleasantly surprised.

It must be said that the film is rather slow, and the scenario a bit basic, but that's not the point. Rather on the framing, the play of light and shadow, the shots, which are beautifully done. The music is also exceptional and immerses us in the atmosphere.

The great success of the film is therefore to have succeeded in establishing a dark, gloomy and sometimes unhealthy atmosphere and yet the film is sometimes baroque and lyrical.

The interpretations are good and especially Max Schreck who interprets Nosferatu in a breathtaking and terrifying way. Like the frightening shadows cast by Count Orlok when he pursues Hunter or Orlok rising stiffly from his coffin, this is a haunting and persistent film.

## To Watch or Not to Watch?
This film is a must see, it is a marvel in the direction and in the music and one of the first horror films (if not the first).
