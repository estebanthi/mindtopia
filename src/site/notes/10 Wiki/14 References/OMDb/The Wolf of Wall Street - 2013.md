Want to have a good laugh with a kinda caricatural movie about money and power? The Wolf of Wall Street is for you.

## Quick summary

This movie talks about a little kind ambitious man wanting to become a millionaire. It becomes with a success story, but it will quickly become a drama as soon as the FBI will begin to investigate.

## My thoughts

The movie is 3 hours long, but you don’t see time passing, except for the last 30 minutes which perhaps were not necessary. The caricatural aspect of the movie is well represented and it really shows how money can affect our psychology and change our personality. It also shows human greed, as we always want more even when we can have everything.

About the realization: everything follows one another, there are very few empty moments even if it happens, and sometimes scenes are too long but what we will remember is that with the sequence of many scenes we have no time to get bored.

Unlike other movies about this environment, there is no need for technical skills or advanced knowledge to understand what is going on. The movie is therefore intended simply to entertain, which is very pleasant for everyone.

## A few words about the casting

Leonardo DiCaprio, playing Jordan Belfort, a true financial guru, is incredible in this role of excess where he goes through a quantity of possible and incredible attitudes.

He does so much in situations all more daring, and crazier than the others that the movie sometimes seems almost tiring and outrageous … And it is at the same time difficult to imagine for us, the life of these men ready to do anything to get rich at any cost until they stubbornly refuse the evidence of an end more than painful and obvious.

Nevertheless, after a good half of the film, when the cocktail of addictions in “all kinds” (drugs, luxury, and lust, then all the rest…!) is well shown, we enter even more into the process of this unusual character to understand him even better. It is then that the Wolf becomes even more ruthless and ferocious in masterful scenes where the animal side is terribly present.

Leonardo DiCaprio signs there undoubtedly one of his best compositions in a movie, finally sometimes a bit disturbing where nothing of nothing is spared to us, it is necessary to admit it, but for the blow also very instructive.  
As for the supporting cast, they are all spectacular and in tune with the hero.

## Final thought

In the end, we remain fascinated by this greed and all those it attracts, whether they are the sprinklers or those being sprinkled, and also to see that whatever happens, the sprinklers always go back to war sooner or later!
