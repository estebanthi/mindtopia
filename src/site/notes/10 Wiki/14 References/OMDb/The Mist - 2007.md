## Quick Summary
The story is about a group of people who find themselves trapped in a supermarket by a supernatural mist that covers the city, and within which lurks frightening creatures.

Although a "monster movie", The Mist also deals with the theme of ordinary people having to act under extraordinary circumstances and becoming violently divided or adopting totally irrational behavior under the pressure of events.

This is the adaptation of Stephen King's short story Mist.

## My Thoughts
I liked "The Mist", even if it is sometimes long, from the beginning.

However, there are some serious flaws. Let's say that two essential aspects of the film are a little missed: the religious criticism, and the study of human behavior in a situation of incomprehension and fear.

For the religious aspect, it is much too caricatural, and the character who represents this aspect is almost embarrassing. He is not at all charismatic and one wonders how he manages to get others to listen to him.

For the other aspect, the "Hollywood law" makes that the heroes are the only ones who think, while the others are stupid and don't follow them, but rather follow mean and personalityless leaders, without thinking

Other flaws are present, and break the realism of the scenario. In particular the creatures that look very much like what we know while... (I won't spoil).

On the other hand, this film is very good, because it fulfills its role as a terror film, a horror film. Indeed, we never know what is this mist, we take time to discover the creatures, etc. ... There is a lot of unknown and uncertainty.

Then the end is terrorizing. Certainly there is a small unrealistic and almost choreographed side, it does not prevent us from imagining perfectly what the main character feels.

The film is therefore very good in spite of big defects. In any case, it watches itself and we don't see the time passing despite more than 2 hours of duration.

## To Watch or Not to Watch
As I said, "The Mist" is really good, despite some flaws. The general public will really appreciate this film, which will appeal less to those for whom the details are really important.
