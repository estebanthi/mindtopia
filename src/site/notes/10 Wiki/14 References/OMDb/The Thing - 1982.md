## Quick Summary
In the heart of Antarctica, a team of researchers discovers a body buried under the snow for over 100,000 years. Thawed out, the creature returns to life, taking the form of whoever it wants to be; from then on, suspicion sets in among the men of the team. Where is the creature hiding? Who is it living with? A real fight begins.

## My Thoughts
The Thing is a simply scary movie. It is one of those films that can keep you on the edge of your seat and scared from beginning to end.

The plot is fantastic at first, but quickly shifts to something psychological. Indeed, the most dangerous thing is not the monster itself (even if I admit that it is quite frightening), but the madness that it engenders within the 12 men. 

Indeed, the thing can be everywhere, can be anyone, and appear at any time. So, no time to get attached to the characters since they can die at any time. In fact, there is not really a main character.

The special effects are extraordinary for a film of the time, and the cast is equally impressive. The soundtrack composed by Ennio Morricone is also very successful.

On the whole, there is nothing missing from this film. It has everything of a good thriller. Even the ending, rather open, makes us wonder. This film is simply a masterpiece.

## To Watch or Not to Watch?
The Thing is one of those films that you don't forget. It is a masterpiece that you absolutely must see!
