## Quick Summary
The lives of guards on Death Row are affected by one of their charges: a black man accused of child murder and rape, yet who has a mysterious gift.

## My Thoughts
After watching [[10 Wiki/14 References/OMDb/The Mist - 2007\|The Mist]] which I liked, I wanted to discover another [[Frank Darabont\|Frank Darabont]] work. I chose The Green Mile, a classic, but I had never watched it.

This movie is an adaptation of the book of the same name written by [[Stephen King\|Stephen King]]. And I found it to be an excellent adaptation of the book.

Well, the movie is a bit long (3h09), but it is fascinating, we do not see the time pass. There are very few long or boring moments, in fact there is always something going on.

The direction is well done and even manages to make this film very moving. The scene before the end scene is absolutely brilliant and sad. And then the ending is just as good, and unexpected.

The characters are endearing, especially John Coffey who at first glance looks like a bully, but in fact we feel sorry for him throughout the film.

The cast is perfect, especially Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan.

It is one of the most moving and touching films I have ever seen.

## To Watch or Not to Watch
I absolutely recommend this movie, this is a must watch. If you are a little bit emotional, you can be sure to shed a tear.
