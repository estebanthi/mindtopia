## Quick Summary

Deformed beings perform in a famous circus, in order to show themselves as fairground phenomena. The liliputian Hans, engaged to the dwarf horsewoman Frieda, is fascinated by the beauty of the acrobat Cleopatra. When she learns that her suitor has inherited a large sum of money, she decides to marry him and then poison him with the help of her lover Hercules. But the plot is discovered, and Hans and Frieda’s friends take revenge…

## My Thoughts

One of the greatest works of fantastic cinema that still evokes a haunting and eerie atmosphere today, “Freaks” by Tod Browning is a film that stands the test of time.

The monsters depicted in the film are not just legends or products of the imagination, but “real monsters”, human beings who are deformed or physically abnormal. In the past, dwarves and hunchbacks were considered entertainers for nobles and royalty, but contemporary society no longer views them in this light. Instead, these “reverse of humanity” are made to be laughed at and considered a constant threat. Dwarves, simian creatures, and bearded women were once considered circus attractions, but Browning elevates the film with his script and genius approach to filmmaking.

He uses these “real monsters” to create a morality tale that is both frightening and thought-provoking. The film is made even more powerful with the performances of show-people who, under Browning’s direction, were able to bring truth to their roles.

The revenge scene is one of the most chilling in the history of cinema and has left a lasting impact on audiences. Despite its initial failure and the decline of Browning’s career, “Freaks” is considered a legendary work by film enthusiasts and is one of a handful of truly unique films. Paradoxically, it is also one of the most misunderstood and cursed works in film history, as it opened a new path that was not followed by others. The general public may embrace the Frankenstein series, but the real and surreal creatures of “Freaks” are often met with rejection and surprise.

## To Watch or Not to Watch?

Freaks is a film that instantly transports you to another era, the early days of talking pictures. It is a classic that you must watch at least once.
