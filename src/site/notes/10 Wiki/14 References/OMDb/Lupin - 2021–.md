## Quick Summary

25 years ago, the life of young Assane Diop is turned upside down when his father dies after being accused of a crime he did not commit. Today, Assane is inspired by his hero, Arsene Lupin — Gentleman Burglar, to avenge him…

## My Thoughts

I wasn’t expecting much from this series, but I was finally pleasantly surprised. It’s not the series of the century but it’s worth watching.

The series sometimes presents a slight side moralizing or cliché a little unpleasant, but we are not in an extreme either.

Some people were disappointed and considered this series to be “a terrible adaptation” of Arsene Lupin. But this is not an adaptation of Arsene Lupin. The character is Assane Diop, and even if it is strongly inspired by him, it is not this character.

There are obviously some scriptural facilities, characters sometimes a bit stupid, and anachronisms, but it is almost a normal thing nowadays and all the series always present these kinds of facilities.

As for the second season, it is different from the first because it only deals with the revenge that Assane Diop is going to set up against Pellegrini who has accused his father of a crime that he did not commit. I found it a bit long at times, especially because of the flashbacks, but there are some good story ideas that kept me in it.

## To Watch or Not to Watch?

On the whole, Lupin is watchable, and even entertaining, on the other hand one should not expect great spectacle. There are still some good twists and turns that keep us in it and can even be impressive at times.
