## Quick Summary
"The Invisible Man" is a 2020 science fiction horror film directed and written by Leigh Whannell, and is a modern retelling of H.G. Wells' 1897 novel of the same name. The film stars Elizabeth Moss as a woman who believes she is being stalked and gaslighted by her abusive ex-boyfriend, who has discovered the power of invisibility.

## My Thoughts
After seeing the trailer, I decided to watch the movie, but I thought it spoiled everything. Well, I was wrong. The movie had a lot more to offer than I expected. Even when one believes they have a grasp of the story, there are always unexpected twists and turns. The plot twist in the last portion of the film made me rethink the entire movie and I found it to be quite ingenious.

Elizabeth Moss was outstanding in her role. The cinematography was also well done. Leigh Whannell is a filmmaker who excels at creating a sense of horror through manipulating the audience's emotions and psychology. The film is successful in evoking a sense of unease throughout the movie, as the horror elements are seamlessly woven into every shot. The story's synopsis leaves much to be interpreted and predicted, adding to the intrigue.


This movie is a good example of a successful remake while being different from the original and unique.

## To Watch or Not to Watch?
I recommend this movie. It was interesting and even if it has some flaws, they are outweighed by the positives.

Whether you're a fan of science fiction/horror films, or you just want a good movie to watch, you can add this one to your watchlist.
