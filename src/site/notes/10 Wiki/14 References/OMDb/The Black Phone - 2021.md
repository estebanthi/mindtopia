## Quick Summary

1978, in a small Colorado town seemingly lacking a school bus service that could prevent many problems, a child kidnapper is on the loose under the noses of the authorities.

Soon, he sets his sights on poor Finney. Locked up in a soundproof basement by his tormentor, the young boy starts receiving phone calls from an old black telephone whose wires have been ripped out…

## My Thoughts

This movie will keep you in a state of tension for almost 2 hours. Between the suspense, some screamers, etc… This aspect is well done.

From the very beginning, we are plunged into an atmosphere of horror and terror, with violence omnipresent both at Finney’s family home and at school.

The scenario is interesting and successful. But there are too many things that we don’t know and that we would have liked to know.

-   What are the intentions of the torturer, why does he kill, and who is he?
-   Where do Finney’s sister’s supernatural dreams come from, why is the phone supernatural too?

The characters and the foundations of the scenario are only partially presented. The movie could have lasted a bit more than 2 hours to present these things, if it would have been well done it wouldn’t have been a problem.

## To Watch or Not to Watch?

Globally, this movie is presented as a horror movie, but I guess it’s more like a thriller because of the intense suspense and tension (even if the end was predictable). If you’re looking for a thriller you can watch without taking the head with the scenario and the realism, go for it, as there is a lot of fantasy.
