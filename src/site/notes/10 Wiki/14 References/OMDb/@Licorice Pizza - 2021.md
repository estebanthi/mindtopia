## Quick Summary

In the 70's, in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, Gary Valentine and Alana Kane will meet.

While one is a 25-year-old woman living with her parents and struggling to get out of her teens, the other is a 15-year-old boy, an actor with an entrepreneurial spirit and destined for a successful career.

A relationship between the two will then develop.

## My Thoughts

Well, Licorice Pizza is one of the films by Paul Thomas Anderson that left me indifferent.

There is no real plot in this film. It is in fact made up of an assembly of almost independent scenes, a bit like mini-movies, but which assembled end to end make sense.

This style didn’t really work for me, as you only need to unhook a few minutes to be lost and find yourself in the middle of a new scene. And it’s easy to lose interest in the film because there are sometimes unnecessary lengths.

At the beginning of the movie, I was surprised and I was like “Oh this movie will be interesting”, but one hour later I was getting tired of it.

Fortunately, it is possible to hold on to other things, notably the incredible reconstruction of the 70’s with beautiful sets and costumes, or the judicious use of music.

Also, the actors were brilliant and played their roles well.

## To Watch or Not to Watch?

This movie is a funny romance looking like a comedy, sometimes a bit satiric.

If you want to clearly know what you watch, this movie can be tedious as it doesn’t really have a plot. If you don’t care, you can enjoy how well the actors play and the beautiful sets, costumes, and music.

I will finish by saying that this film is rather perfect from an artistic and visual point of view, but much less so from a directing point of view and maybe even from the script. It will however please many people for sure, especially those wanting to enjoy a beautiful visual and auditive performance.
