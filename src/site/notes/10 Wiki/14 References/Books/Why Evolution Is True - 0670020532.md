## Quick Summary

There are many theories trying to explain our appearance on Earth. One of the most common is the theory of evolution, originally developed by Darwin.

This theory has given rise to many controversies, and today the main rival of this theory is the creationist theory, establishing that if we are on Earth, it is thanks to an external intentional act.

“Why Evolution is True” is a summary of the main arguments of the theory of evolution against the creationist theory.

## My Thoughts

This book was incredibly interesting. I wondered why I only became interested in biology now, because I realize that it is something fascinating.

One thing that is very successful in the book is the neutrality of the author. Since the goal is to dismantle creationist arguments, it is essential to adopt a neutral position in order to be heard. It is successful. The author is content to enumerate facts, to expose what is and what is not, without bringing any subjectivity.

Moreover, this means that those who could get the most out of this book will not read it. Indeed, religious fundamentalists, who do not believe in facts and only believe in miracles, will close this book after the first few pages for fear of seeing a well-constructed argument destroy their beliefs.

Otherwise, the book is rather well done because it is not only for creationists, but for everyone, because it explains Darwin’s theory with pedagogy. Whether you want to discover evolution, to start your interest in biology, or to improve your existing knowledge, this book will certainly interest you. Provided that you are open-minded of course.

I read the book “Human by Design: From Evolution by Chance to Transformation by Choice” by Gregg Braden a few months ago. It’s a creationist book suggesting that the Theory of Evolution doesn’t apply to us and that we’re the product of an intentional act of creation. It was an interesting read too and it’s kinda funny to see how these two books contradict themselves while keeping objective. I suggest you read it after or before reading “Why Evolution is True”.

## To Read or Not to Read?

Whether you want to know more about evolution or to polish your knowledge, or even if you think we were made by creation, I recommend you this book.

The science inside is admirable and very well explained using examples, making it an enjoyable and interesting read in any case.
