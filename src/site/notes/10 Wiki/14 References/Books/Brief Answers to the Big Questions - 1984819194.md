## Quick Summary

Does God exist? How did the universe begin? Are we alone in the universe? And so on…

In this book, Stephen Hawking discusses quickly some of the most important and fundamental questions in science and philosophy.

## My Thoughts

Hawking is known for his ability to explain in a simple and concise way terribly complex things. Once again, this is confirmed in this book. Indeed, Hawking was able to explain in a few pages things that would require entire books. And even if it doesn’t go into much detail, we get a good grasp of the subject.

Hawking is not only a brilliant scientist but also an exceptional teacher, and a good writer. His writing style is clear and concise, and he uses metaphors to help readers understand even the most complex concepts.

I appreciated Hawking’s sense of humor, which made reading and learning from the book a pleasure. Although I may not necessarily agree with all of his beliefs, I have a great deal of respect for his ideas and appreciate his open-minded approach to finding the truth.

It’s a book that will make you think and appreciate one of the greatest scientists of his generation.

## To Read or Not to Read?

“Brief Answers to the Big Questions” is a must-read for anyone interested in science and philosophy. It offers valuable insights into some of the most pressing issues facing the world today and provides a glimpse into Hawking’s personality and determination through his own writing style.

His theories will no doubt continue to inspire and influence many for years to come and this book is a good basis to start understanding the world around us.
