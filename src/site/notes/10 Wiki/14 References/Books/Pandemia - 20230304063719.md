## Quick Summary
Like every morning, Amandine left her glass house for the Pasteur Institute. But this morning was special. Called to take samples at the Marquenterre ornithological reserve, the microbiologist was disconcerted: three swans' corpses were lying on a stretch of water.
In the forest of Meudon, a man and his dog had been shot. In the nearby pond, a canvas bag containing bones: four bodies in kit form.
And during this time, a flu with an unidentifiable strain turns into an epidemic...

## My Thoughts
Very good book, which reads quickly, if not in a day. Indeed, difficult to close it once started.

The plot is well found, original, and makes you think about certain things by exposing threats not necessarily known by the general public.

There are many twists and turns, unexpected things, etc. ...

In short, a very good read!

## To Read or Not to Read?
I highly recommend this book if you like thrillers.
