## Quick Summary
When Louise finds out her parents have died, she dreads going home. She doesn’t want to leave her daughter with her ex and fly to Charleston. She doesn’t want to deal with her family home, stuffed to the rafters with the remnants of her father’s academic career and her mother’s lifelong obsession with puppets and dolls. She doesn’t want to learn how to live without the two people who knew and loved her best in the world.

Most of all, she doesn’t want to deal with her brother, Mark, who never left their hometown, gets fired from one job after another, and resents her success. Unfortunately, she’ll need his help to get the house ready for sale because it’ll take more than some new paint on the walls and clearing out a lifetime of memories to get this place on the market.

But some houses don’t want to be sold, and their home has other plans for both of them.

## My Thoughts
I didn't really like this book. In fact I read it diagonally. I felt like I was reading a book for teenagers, maybe it's just that I don't like the author's style.

Anyway, I found the scenario a bit shaky. An imaginary dog, a possessed puppet, etc... Of course, the story wasn't always boring, there were some nice moments, and the characters are a bit endearing.

This book also made me feel some emotions, I didn't really expect it. So it's not all bad. But as I said, the author's style is quite particular and makes you think you're reading a book for teenagers.

In short, I just didn't like the story, but there was still potential in the characters.

## To Read or Not to Read?
I think this book may appeal to a younger audience than me, so I would recommend it to teenagers.
