## Quick Summary
A book recounting the story of the catastrophic consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, its impact on those who survived, and the tragedy that followed.

On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant suffered a meltdown, resulting in the worst nuclear disaster of the 20th century. A cloud containing radioactive materials spread far and wide, exposing an unsuspecting population to dangerous levels of radiation. At 19 years old, Emmanuel Lepage was horrified as he watched the news unfold on television.

22 years later, in April 2008, Emmanuel journeyed to Chernobyl to document through words and illustrations the lives of those still living in the highly contaminated area. He felt like he was tempting fate, and as he boarded a train to Ukraine, where the disaster took place, he couldn't shake the thought: "What am I doing here?"

## My Thoughts
An interesting read and a bit different from the way the subject is usually treated.

I liked the perspective of the "foreigner", with his fear of radiation, contrasting so nicely with the locals who seem to live without too much trouble.

I just think there is a lack of testimonials, so we we missed the events a bit because the people we met didn't seem more concerned by the disaster. In spite of this, the author succeeds in making us feel the insidious side of the irradiation and how quickly it is forgotten without the worrying tick of the meter.

His experience and the difficulty of telling it are skillfully explained by the text and nicely illustrated thanks to the pleasant line and the different techniques used. I actually found the drawings beautiful, and you have to take the time to appreciate them while reading this comic. The atmosphere is well transcribed and the opposition between the ruins of the nuclear accident and the apparent purity of nature is one of the artistic and narrative strengths of the book.


A good introduction to the subject and a good complement for those who have already dug a little into the event, for the encouraging side of the "after".

## To Read or Not to Read?
Whether you're interested in the topic of the Chernobyl disaster or you're new to the subject, or you just enjoy art, you can be interested in this comic and its beautiful drawings.
