# Technical Analysis
---
Technical analysis focuses on what is, rather than what should be. It focuses on the market itself, not on the external factors that it reflects or that may have influenced it. It describes market movements, not the reasons behind them. It focuses on the psychology of traders, not on the facts.

*Technical analysis does not have to be right: you just have to believe it to get results.

Traders and novice traders often make the same mistakes. This is what allows more experienced traders to make profits.

All the data currently available is visible in the prices, which makes it possible to anticipate news, positive or negative.
