# GTD
---
[[Get Things Done\|Get Things Done]] is a way to manage tasks. I have my own adaptation of this system.

## Flow
```mermaid
graph TD;
	A["What are my ðŸ—»?"]
	--> B["Divide ðŸ—» into ðŸš§"]
	--> C["Divide ðŸš§ into ðŸŽ¯"]

	E["âœ… idea"]
	E -->|"The âœ… is related to a project"|F["Capture to associated ðŸš§ or ðŸŽ¯"]
	E -->|"The âœ… is independent"|G["Capture to ðŸ“¥"]
```
