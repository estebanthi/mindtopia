# My Zettelkasten Workflow
---
I organize my notes in a [[Zettelkasten\|Zettelkasten]] style. I characterize my notes according to an [[10 Wiki/Status/Epistemic Status - 20230112085426\|Epistemic Status]] meaning my notes evolved over time.

## Plantations
One thing I don't mention in the [[10 Wiki/Status/Epistemic Status - 20230112085426\|Epistemic Status]] note is the fact that I use [[10 Wiki/Status/Plantation - 20230114032002\|Plantations]] (to continue with the plant analogy) to group several ideas together.

This way, I don't have to deal with a folder structure, which I don't like because it implies to classify my knowledge notes. And I don't want that, I want my notes to be as atomic as possible.

## Rejuvenation
I still have not decided a way to effectively review my notes. For now, [[10 Wiki/Status/Rejuvenated - 20230114014237\|Rejuvenated]] is a status I've never used.

I don't want to erase content when reviewing notes, but at the same time I don't want a note to be a mess.

This note will be updated when I will have found a solution.
