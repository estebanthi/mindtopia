# 2023-02-08 - From Markdown to Databases
---
In the last update ([[30 Public/32 Updates/2023-01-31 - LifeOS to Notion\|2023-01-31 - LifeOS to Notion]]), I decided to move most of my personal stuff to Notion, because I think the Notion's databases are very powerful. But I just figured out I used Notion just for this feature. So why not moving everything to an app focusing only on databases?

I experimented with Airtable. It's a good software, but I don't like its restrictions for its free tier. And I don't plan to pay for something I could do in Obsidian. Moreover, the data stored in Airtable was not mine and I could not back it up.

So I decided to use NocoDB instead. It's a bit less powerful, but I don't care because it's free and I don't want something very complex. I host it on a VM with Google Cloud using the free tier. The data is mine (even if it's hosted by Google) and is backed up to my own server every day.

## What does this have to do with Mindtopia?
I used Obsidian a lot for daily logs. To track things I have to do, to read, to keep logs of things I discovered, of people I met, etc...

All this stuff is now in NocoDB as it perfectly fits in a database system. One month ago, everything about me and all my logs were in Mindtopia. Now they're not.

The only things I keep here are things requiring big notes. So, weekly reviews, meeting reports, book reviews, etc... and pure PKM stuff such as my [[Zettelkasten\|Zettelkasten]] system. This stuff fits perfectly in Obsidian as Obsidian was intended first to be a PKM system, even if it can do everything now thanks to plugins.
