# 2023-01-31 - LifeOS to Notion
---
The first major update to my vault. It's a big update for me, but you, you won't see a lot of changes.

I just decided to move all my life/task/project management stuff from [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]] to Notion. Why?
- I needed a way to access this stuff easily from mobile.
- Notion databases are a powerful feature that I needed, and the DB Folder plugin is good but can't really reproduce this feature.
- More globally, I think Notion is better for this kind of stuff and makes it easier to handle it than [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]].

Before, I had a working system, but it lacked a lot of things. So I've switched to the [[PPV System\|PPV System]] by [[August Bradley\|August Bradley]]. I tried to build this system in [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]], but it wasn't working well and caused too much friction. A system is useless if you can't use it correctly.

By the way, this made all this stuff private, which is a good thing I think as some things I plan to do in the future should remain privates. The only downside is that I can't really show you how my system work. But I'll probably make some Medium articles, or some workflow notes here, to explain it.
