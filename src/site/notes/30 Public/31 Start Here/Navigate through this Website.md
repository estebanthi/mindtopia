# Navigate through this Website
---
There's nothing easier as navigating through this website!

On the left side, you have the **file explorer**. I think you already know how to use it.

On the right side, you have:
- The **graph view**: it allows you to see the pages linked to the actual page
- **On this page**: allows you to navigate through the headers of the page
- **Pages mentioning this page**

Sometimes you can also find links in my notes. [[Here\|Here]] is a link. But it references no existing note, so you'll get a 404 error if you click on it. When a link references an existing note, you'll get to the corresponding note by clicking it.

You can also find hashtags such as #a-random-hashtag. For now, nothing happens when you click on hashtags.
