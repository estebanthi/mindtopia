# Support Me
---
Most of the things I create are free and will always be, Mindtopia included. I don't like the idea of selling knowledge, even if it's something massively widespread.

However, knowing I have people who like what I'm doing and having a little support is always fine. If you like my work, you can tell it to me by [[30 Public/31 Start Here/Contact Me\|contacting me]], leaving comments on this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/estebanthi/my-digital-garden), or [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/estebanthi).

Thanks!
