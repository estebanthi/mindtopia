# How I Made this Website
---
Well, I can't say I made this website. The notes are mine, but everything concerning the deployment of my notes on the web is managed by an [Obsidian plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) created by [oleeskild](https://github.com/oleeskild).

So I can just thank you, oleeskild!

I won't copy/paste the documentation of this plugin here, so if you really want to know how a website like this can technically be made, check this link: https://dg-docs.ole.dev/.
