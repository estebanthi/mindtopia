# Welcome
---
Hello and welcome to the public version of my [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]] vault! I've made this vault to showcase how I use [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]] and to **share my knowledge**. You can also find more personal stuff such as my projects or my workflows.

## Some things to know
From a technical point of view, this vault is a website and not a real [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]] vault (check [[How I Made this Website\|How I Made this Website]]). So, some details are hidden such as metadata. Also, plugins don't work so you can sometimes see strange things in my notes.

This vault is public, **all the things here are things I want to share**. It means there are things I don't want to share, so some links or things might not work or be inaccessible for you.

This vault is **living**. Its structure may change from one day to the other and my notes are never in their final state.

**There is no absolute truth**, and although I try to be as accurate and objective as possible, it is possible that some of my notes contain erroneous or even contradictory information. I therefore disclaim all responsibility for any use you make of them!

**I'm not a natural English speaker**. I do my best, but there can be typos, misspelled words, or things that don't mean anything for you. Don't blame me.

## An important thing!
**This vault is for me**. This may seem contradictory, but the main purpose of this vault is not to be seen by as many people as possible! This is mainly my second brain, and for you an additional resource. If you find it useful, fine, but it is mainly made to meet MY needs.

Anyway, I hope most of you will find it useful!
