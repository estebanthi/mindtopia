# Rejuvenated
---
Rejuvenation is the process of attempting to revive or revitalize a plant that may have lost its vigor or vitality. This can be done through pruning, fertilizing, or other methods, but it carries the risk that the plant may not respond well to the treatment and could even deteriorate further.

A note with the status of "Rejuvenated" implies that **the idea or concept has been revisited** in an effort to improve or refresh it. However, this process carries the risk of potentially altering the note in such a way that it becomes worse than the original. Therefore, further validation and evaluation are necessary to determine the effectiveness of the changes made.
