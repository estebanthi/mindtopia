# Plantation
---
When you group several plants together, it's called a plantation.

The "Plantation" status is a special status. It says that the note's main purpose is to group ideas together. To better understand what is this status, you should check [[004 Workbench/00 Inbox/Why I don't Use a Folder Structure\|Why I don't Use a Folder Structure]]. Basically, it's a [[Map of Content\|Map of Content]].

> [!TIP]
One powerful thing with plantations, is that you can group them together to make bigger plantations, just like a forest is a small part of the global vegetation of a country!

>[!EXAMPLE]
A plantation called "Astrophysics" can be part of a bigger plantation called "Physics", part of a bigger plantation called "Science".
