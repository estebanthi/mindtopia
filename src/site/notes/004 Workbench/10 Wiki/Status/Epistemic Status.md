# Epistemic Status
---
Epistemic status refers to the degree of confidence or certainty that one has in a particular piece of information or belief. It's a way to express how much we think we know about something.

This concept is important because it recognizes that we hold different levels of certainty about different things.

One funny thing is that even the epistemic status of epistemic statuses is subject to change and uncertainty. It highlights that we should be open to change.


## Levels
